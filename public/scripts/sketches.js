At an early hour the dele gates came into the hall, talking in loud voices, and fanning vigorously with broad brimmed straw hats. The meeting was called to order at eleven o\'clock, and Mr Felton arrived by the noonday train. \\"I wish had come week ago,\\" he said to Charley Weston, his private secretary, as they left the car together. \\"I owed it to my friends however, suppose the delegates are all right.\\" \\"I am sure of it,\\" Weston replied. smile passed over his face. \\"The country demands your return. Mr Felton made pleased assent. \\"Why didn\'t ye let the boys know ye was coming, they\'d have met ye with band,\\" the man added heartily, and they rumbled rapidly into the town. But Mr Felton was not reassured; one thing had troubled him all the way from Washington Rans was in the Convention. Why had his friends permitted this man to be named as delegate? He knew it was easy to defeat the will of the people, and that an organized opposition could snap its fingers in the face of the most popular candidate. In middle Tennessee, in the heart of the Blue Grass Region, lived Mr Felton and Mr Rans. These men had been enemies from boyhood, enemies with force that almost became to them faith. This old hate was something they could go back to, it was some thing they were sure of in their lives. These two were meant to be friends the parallelism in their ancestry ran back into the old North State, where their grandfathers, Presbyterian to the core, fought side by side in the war of the Revolution and, after peace was declared, the old comrades journeyed together to the new country that was called Tennessee. The Felton was richer than the Rans, and divided with him his living; the Rans was physically stronger, abler to cope with pioneer emergency, and so balanced the scale of mutual benefit. But one generation is not an earnest of the other, either in friendship or finance, for the representative of the Rans\' name now led in the race for wealth, and the descendant of the Felton family desired above all else place and power. The latter was by profession lawyer, by inclination politician. In this he had been fairly successful, having served many terms in the state legislature, and was now for the third time asking re-election to the Congress of the United States. The Convention got to work very deliberately; it saw no reason to hurry; its utterances were final, nomination being equivalent to an election. The country dele gates, however, insisted upon naming the permanent chairman they said, \\"that it was time they had some recognition.\\" Feeling secure, and at the same time being anxious to appear generous, the Felton men conceded this point, and the county candidate, Esquire Strong, was elected, practically without opposition. Later it became known that Strong was the supporter of Clarke, Felton\'s only opponent for the nomination. So far nothing had transpired to indicate anything but perfect harmony. Resolutions commending the party platform had been read and enthusiastically indorsed. These called forth considerable speech making from the leaders which as the day was young did not weary the crowd, and put the orators themselves in an excellently good humor. Reports from the various committees came in without delay. contest in one of the upper counties, which brought two delegations to the Convention, both claiming to be regulars, was settled by dividing the vote equally between the contestants. The time had now arrived for the nominations, and greater, more concentrated earnestness and interest was felt over the house. Buckets of ice water were placed on stands in different parts of the hall, and palm leaf fans were passed to all the delegates, these last with the \\"Compliments of Archibald Rans. This gentleman seemed ubiquitous and tireless, he trotted around in every direction, fan in one hand, handkerchief, with which he mopped the perspiration from his face, in the other. He did not talk much, but made his presence felt wherever he went. Suddenly Mr Felton\'s friends were aroused they began to suspect plot, then they be came sure of one their fault had been overconfidence. They hurried from one delegation to another; they argued, quarreled, and in low tones uttered threats. But their efforts were apparently without avail. The first ballot was counted, and Mr Felton\'s vote fell thirty short of nomination. The next ballot showed no change; the third was taken with like result, the Felton men bending all their energies to hold his majority. On the fourth ballot he gained five votes, and they shouted wildly; on the fifth he still gained; on the sixth he gained ten more; the excitement was now intense. The seventh was taken amid great confusion, and Felton\'s vote fell back to that of the first ballot. On the eighth he lost; on the ninth he lost; and then he had less than majority of the Convention. The Felton men, who had been reassured by the gain in votes, now were nonplussed, they could not tell what was holding the Convention back. Clarke was evidently cat\'s paw the opposition did not want him. Could it be, they questioned among themselves, their candidate\'s speech on the monetary bill pending in the House? Possibly, and if so, some concessions might be made. committee was hurried to the hotel to wait upon the congress man, but he positively declined, as he said, \\"to sell his convictions for office.\\" \\"Let them defeat me,\\" he cried, indignantly, \\"they have turned down many better man.\\" Just as the tenth ballot was announced, Mr Felton entered the hall. After the applause his entrance created had subsided, he arose and withdrew his name from before the Convention. \\"When one comes to lay down trust,\\" he said, \\"a review of the course he has pursued inevitably passes before him it has already passed before this body. What have done, what have left undone,\\" speaking directly to the delegates, \\"is as familiar to you as to me; through it all have faithfully sought your good, only dominated by the good of the whole party. We have, at times, differed upon great questions before the country. have regretted this, but believed then, and believe now that when you have gone deeper into the subject you will agree with me. At any rate, one must stand by his honest convictions no matter at what personal cost. You, fellow citizens, cannot misunderstand me. You know me too well to think that could change for any office within your gift my lifelong opinion of national policy and personal right. thank you for the honors, beyond my deserts, you have already conferred upon me. thank my friends the old guard who so nobly stand by me now, and beg to state that my name is no longer before the Convention. He sat down; the delegates seemed to rise as one man, they gathered around him they wrung his hand, the hall was filled with shouts of his name, they refused to accept his withdrawal, and he left the house followed by crowd of his admirers. \\"It is too late now,\\" he said to one of them as together they entered the hotel; \\"had come earlier could have managed it, but Rans is in the Convention, and has strong pull on some of the delegates. They would like to vote for me, but he dominates them.\\" \\"He has been using his money,\\" the man replied with an oath. They parted, and Mr Felton entered his own room and closed the door. It was hotel, but hotel had been his home for years. He had never married. Early in life, when poverty and he were comrades, in an imperious, half-defiant way he had loved. The remembrance stirred him still, and at times it would make him start up and walk, in that long stride of his, up and down the room. The world called him stern, unfeeling; he was only reserved. There had been nothing in his associations or surroundings to develop the lighter, gentler side of his character. He had grappled with realities, with cold, deliberate facts from his boyhood. He now strode up and down the floor, passing his fingers through his hair, or clutching them together behind his back. He was trying to think, to plan, to contrive some way to turn the tide of opposition. He was not one to give up without struggle. Despite the apprehension of the morning, the disaffection of his old party associates shocked him greatly. There were men in the Convention voting against him that had been his political supporters for years; one of them he had caused to be appointed postmaster; another, after bitter fight, he had succeeded in having retained as marshal. There was rising young lawyer to whom he had thrown many minor cases, and an old farmer, to save whose feelings he had refused to prosecute his son for murder, and there was one, ballot-box stuffer here the congressman winced who would be now in the penitentiary but for powerful political influence. There must be reason for this sudden change, he argued. Of course Rans was at the bottom of it, but where did he get his hold, how did he acquire his influence? Impatiently he walked to the window and looked out. The street below was full of people, as the Convention had adjourned till seven o\'clock that evening. crowd of delegates was standing on the corner just below him, Rans in the midst of them, and everybody was laughing and talking, seemingly in state of high good humor. Mr Felton watched Rans and his friends, till they moved off together and entered neigh boring saloon. \\"D him,\\" he said aloud, and left the window. \\"Who?\\" his secretary asked, entering the room as Mr Felton spoke. He has done it all, Charley. Before God, I\'d like to kill him.\\" \\"So should I,\\" and young Weston sprang to his feet. \\"If you say so, will do it.\\" \\"No, no; need no one to help me with the scoundrel.\\" He stopped suddenly, then added, \\"yet he has always slipped in by his low methods ahead of me.\\" \\"We will beat him yet you were within fifteen votes of nomination on last ballot.\\" Mr Felton\'s face cleared for an instant, then he shook his head. \\"Yes, and lacked twenty the ballot before, and twenty-five the one before that; now, have run up to within fifteen, may get to within ten, but cannot be nominated in that Convention Rans controls enough votes to prevent it. swept my eye over the body, and saw him. The low cunning was beaming from his countenance; he seemed too well satisfied not to be secure. He is good at figures, and knows his men.\\" \\"I have some mail here,\\" Weston said, laying numerous letters and packages upon the table. \\"Look and see if there is anything of importance,\\" stopping in his restless walk to listen. Charley tore open letter after letter, some on the political situation, some in reference to bills pending in the House. There was also an invitation to make speeches in one of the doubtful states. \\"We shall soon be through with all this, old fellow,\\" Mr Felton said, and impatiently brushed letters and newspapers aside. Nothing pleased him, his plans were frustrated, the props knocked from under him, and he was dissatisfied with himself, mortified that he should be again outgeneraled by Rans. \\"Here is letter marked \'personal\' that you should open yourself,\\" Weston said, endeavoring to appear calm, though feeling nearly as much discomfited as was his chief. Mr Felton took it from him, and, without looking at the address, broke the seal. \\"So Agnes is dead,\\" he said aloud, laying the letter down, \\"has been dead nearly year. The secretary looked up inquiringly. \\"She was my only brother\'s wife,\\" he explained. \\"He died many years ago; you have never heard me speak of her. She did not grieve long for poor Jeff. hardly thought her out of her weeds when she wrote me she was to be married again. Yes,\\" as though talking to himself, \\"she was pretty, very pretty,\\" he laughed hard, unpleasant laugh, \\"but never liked her. They had child,\\" starting up. \\"Read the letter, Charley, and see if they say anything about it believe it was girl. After Jeff died took little interest in them.\\" He walked back to the window. \\"The Convention is assembling, you should go,\\" he said. \\"Not for half an hour yet, Weston glanced at his watch as he spoke. \\"There will be some men here to see you before it meets. They have scheme on hand, by which they hope to do something with the Dare County delegation; it is really friendly to us.\\" Then taking up the letter, \\"It seems the daughter writes this, Mr Felton, it commences \'My dear Uncle,\' and is signed \'Viola Felton.\' \\"I had not noticed,\\" coming back to the table. \\"It is clear to me now,\\" looking it over again. \\"Her mother is dead, she writes to tell me. It is sad letter, Charley. She says am her only kin she has come to the valley of dry bones for relation, hasn\'t she?\\" His face looked grim and careworn. \\"I shall write to her sometime, but cannot think of it now. Put the letter away, Charley. There was knock at the door, and soon the room was filled with his political supporters. The Convention lasted for days; there were wire pulling and talking, and attempts to man age, but the vote stood practically the same. Through the long, exhausting sessions, Rans seemed perfectly content. placid smile continually expanded his round, well-fed face. Weston swore that it glistened and shone with pleasure. Whenever ballot was called, he calmly awaited the result. \\"Your votes are not wavering, Elijah?\\" he said to the chairman of the Dare County delegations. \\"They are all right, Mr Rans,\\" was the reply; \\"I can influence them,\\" and the man passed on, disturbed look on his face. \\"If were out of your power I\'d show you how our people would vote,\\" he thought, as he took his seat. The weather continued very warm, the wind coming in through the wide-open windows was as the breath of furnace, and the dust from the stony streets made everything dry and stifling. Many of the delegates looked wilted and indifferent, lounging in depressed, relaxed heaps in their chairs. But the party leaders showed no yielding to climatic influence. The heat may have made them trifle more inflammable and pugnacious, but they were there for purpose and would leave no means untried to accomplish it. Saturday morning the Convention met at the usual hour. It had been in session for nearly week, and those delegates who did not live in the town were anxious to get back to their homes. The balloting began with the monotonous result the dead-lock still prevailed Mr Felton lacked fifteen votes of nomination. His friends now gathered their forces for final rally; they made speeches, and endeavored to impress upon the Convention the weight and significance of the majority. They said for nearly week, day after day, it had been shown that Mr Felton was the choice of more than one-half of the dele gates, and they declared by every precedent of party policy the opposition ought gracefully to yield. They closed with eulogies on the character, attainments, and well-known public service of their candidate. They felt they could not stop, and could not say too much, so, one after another, the congressman\'s neighbors and friends sprang to their feet, and old Southern eloquence and loyalty rang through the hall. For the first time since the Convention assembled Rans grew pale. Had he lost his hold? Was vengeance slipping from his grasp? The men about him were evidently moved. He hastily scribbled note, and sent it away, then he leaned back in his chair, and tried to appear indifferent; but his hands were nervous and left free they trembled. As there conies lull before storm, so silence fell upon the Convention. Men forgot to talk and looked about them expectantly. They knew that the crisis was at hand, that at last something was going to happen. Besides, disintegrating process had been going on slowly among the delegates; their outlook, their point of view was shifting; they were ripe for suggestion, for direction. As though in response to the general look of inquiry, in the extreme end of the hall delegate rose and made his way up the main aisle until he stood almost directly in front of the chairman\'s desk. He was lawyer from the adjoining town, and he held Rans\' note in his hand. At first his voice was scarcely audible, and his manner hesitating, deprecating; everything about him was conciliatory, as if he feared to be hissed or stormed down but gaining confidence as he went on, he spoke with decision and force. He said, as the eloquent speakers before him had stated they had sat there for days, wrangling over deadlock that seemed impossible to break. \\"The candidates!\\" here he threw back his head in hearty good comradeship, \\"why all know them; they are splendid citizens, whole-souled, brainy men, abundantly able to represent this district or any other district on God\'s earth in Congress. But, gentle men, he passed his handkerchief across his brow, and smiled, \\"we have proved by the sweat of our faces for nearly week that neither of the aspirants, however worthy, is the choice of two-thirds of this body. now insist that all instruction be removed, all candidates withdrawn, and that we proceed to put other men in nomination, or else,\\" he shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows, \\"let us adjourn and go home to our people and tell them we were not able to do what they sent us here to do. We are no one man\'s district,\\" he declared earnestly, \\"we have many party leaders worthy of promotion. again ask that all instructions be removed, and we proceed to agree upon candidate.\\" There were hisses and cries of \\"No, no!\\" But he continued his speech, and when he had finished, the hall rang with applause, in which many, whom Weston did not know were wavering, joined. The Felton delegates held conference, however, and refused to withdraw their man. At the sound of his name half the Convention was on its feet, the opposition had at last showed its hand. The ballot was taken amid hisses, and howls, and cheers. When the result was announced it was found that Rans had divided the vote with Mr Felton. The Felton men were desperate, the Rans followers triumphant. The next ballot showed gain for Rans, and corresponding loss for Felton. Rans was popular all over the district, except where his tyranny in business way had been felt, and he had never been mentioned as political possibility, which fact stood him in good stead now. If they could not get Mr Felton and that seemed impossible where would they find more practical business man, one who understood the needs of the people better than Mr Rans? He was no politician, so much the better for that. On each succeeding ballot the Rans majority increased. His gains were so considerable that he was within few votes of nomination. The Felton phalanx seemed to go all to pieces; the leaders lost nerve and confidence. Charley Weston jumped on chair and with drew Mr Felton\'s name. Rans\' nomination on the next ballot appeared inevitable. Mr Felton now came slowly into the Convention, and stood talking with the delegation of his own county. Some one had given him proxy and he was member of the body. He looked grave, but very quiet and unconcerned. No one could have told there was difference he did not show it by the flicker of an eye-lash. His presence brought forth the old applause they had never failed to give him. When it subsided, he said: \\"I am here to tell you that though un horsed can fight in the ranks, and in the future, as in the past, in office and out of office, we will battle side by side for the good of our great party the fundamental principles are in our hearts and shall ever command our support. In surveying the field, in casting about for candidate there are many whom we would love to honor. (A cry of \\"Why not you?\\") \\"My friend, that is out of the question,\\" waving his hand to silence him. \\"As have said, there are many strong men among us; men who should receive the unanimous support of this Convention, and of the people at the polls. But there is one who comes to me pre-eminently, above all others, leader of leaders, great man among great men, honest, loyal, unswerving one whom you would honor yourselves in honoring.\\" He stopped and let his eyes run slowly over the body of attentive listeners. \\"I mean the Hon. James H. Justice. Gentlemen, place him in nomination and ask for him your honest, unbought support.\\" The last two words were hissed from between his teeth, and he looked directly into Rans\' face. There was considerable excitement during this speech, as only few present knew whom Mr Felton would name. When he had concluded, and an old man, universally popular and beloved, against whom no factional fight had been waged, was before the Convention, it went wild with enthusiasm. The Rans sup porters fell away like mist. Judge Justice was nominated, and the Convention was over. sudden discontent, fierce loathing that was born of the excitement and disappointment, passed over the congressman as he left the cheering crowd behind him, and sought the open air. \\"A set of howling hoodlums,\\" he muttered between clinched teeth. \\"They do not know what they are shouting for, it would have been just the same had it been I, or Clarke, or Rans. They had never thought of Justice till nominated him.\\" \\"Well, you defeated Rans, Mr Felton,\\" Charley Weston said, coming up to him just outside of the building. \\"Yes, cold comfort that,\\" was the reply; then looking down at Weston, \\"Justice did not want it, Charley, told him he was our chance to checkmate Rans, and he consented. crowd of delegates rushed out of the hall almost brushing against the defeated candidate without being conscious of his proximity. They took the middle of the street, band met them at the corner. Their business was plain Mr Felton and Weston looked at each other and smiled the committee was going to notify Judge Justice of his good fortune. \\"If you had not come just when you did, Felton, Rans would have been nominated on the next ballot,\\" one of his friends said, catching up with the congressman and his secretary. \\"Yes, know it,\\" wearily. \\"Charley,\\" turning to Weston, \\"we will go back to Washington to-morrow.\\" And he went in, closed the door of his private room and was alone. At first instinctively he began restless pace up and down the floor; then he threw off his coat, and stretched himself across the bed. The man had been under great excitement; had held himself under tension; but now he could relax for the suspense was over, and \\"defeat meant nothing more than defeat.\\" For days he had not slept; now he slumbered in peace, and when he awoke the long shadows of the evening were upon the earth. He arose and stood at the window letting the cool breezes touch his cheek. After time he went out, made his way through the Square, then down the principal street leading from the town he passed his own law office, and looked up at the sign in dazed way. As he did so, the newspaper\'s grim joke of the politician out of job came to him, and he repeated aloud, \\"Felton, attorney-at-law, and smiled. On he went past the Institute whose gray, ivy-clad towers stood as sentinels, and now the cool, grass-spread, undulating country stretched out before him. He knew it all was it not the theater of his youthful exploits There he had shot partridges, and trapped them, too, and farther on treed \'possums and coons and run foxes (the hounds baying music), all his boyhood. The scene rested him now. The wind that came from over the fields was like the breath of his youth, the years slipped away, the hurry, and tramp of earth were silent, the fever of unrest had gone. \\"What is the use of this impetuous haste? The summer season is so brief at best, Let us look on the stars and pluck the flowers, And when our feet grow weary, let us rest.\\" But life rejoices in sharp contrasts, and swift revulsions of feeling. As he stood there on rise in the road, taking in anew the old, familiar bearings some one passed him, and voice, the discord of his early days, said \\"How d\'ye do, Mr Felton? pleasant day, sir!\\" The congressman started at the sound; in an instant every nerve was aquiver, the blood tingling to the ends of his veins. Looking up quickly, his eyes fell upon Rans only few feet farther up the gradually sloping hill. The latter had almost reached the top, and his short, rotund figure made very unsightly silhouette against the pleasant evening sky. Mr Felton bounded forward and whirled Rans around in the road, for he imagined he saw triumphant smile through the back of his enemy\'s head. \\"Did you address me, sir?\\" from between closed teeth. \\"I merely said, \'How d\'ye do?\' As he spoke Rans glanced up into Felton \'s face, and his own blanched, for all the pent-up, aggregated fury of lifetime seemed unloosed. \\"And why did you presume to speak to me?\\" the congressman demanded. \\"Look here,\\" grasping Rans\'s shoulder, and holding it firmly, \\"there is no use in pretending not to know what you have done to-day, and why you did it the old fires are not out with either of us. We came near settling scores twenty years ago down yonder,\\" pointing through the trees; \\"would to God we had done so. You miserable spawn of the earth, you traitor to every higher shaking him as he spoke. \\"Take care! take care!\\" Rans shouted, breaking away, his own eyes blazing; \\"I am no match for you physically, but am armed. Defend yourself !\\" and quickly drawing pistol he leveled it at Felton\'s head. \\"Put up your weapon,\\" the lawyer cried, striding toward him, \\"or shoot if you dare. No,\\" sneeringly, \\"your bullets are silver, they are never used in guns. Going closer, as Rans stood irresolute, he wrenched the pistol from his hand and threw it to the side of the road. \\"So much for your arms. Now hear me,\\" advancing his head in front of his body, and speaking in low, deliberate tones. \\"This is the last time you shall ever cross my path. swear it. Do so again at your peril. You should not live now except for the bare possibility in my mind that Mary loves you. Now go.\\" And Rans went. Mr Felton\'s eye followed the retreating figure till turn in the road hid it from view. \\"As tribute to the past, Mary,\\" he said, with wave of his hand and bow of old-time courtesy. Then he walked rapidly back to town. That night was spent talking over the political situation with his friends, and the next morning he and Weston left for Washington. There is difference in returning to the field of labor after defeat; the old worship of the rising sun is brought home. The world loves success, for there is something wrong somewhere when one does not get it. The heart may be all right, and one may be just as good fellow, but not nearly so useful friend. So the world will believe to the end. Mr Felton was conscious of such thought when he returned he, the invincible, had been brought down. His colleagues gathered about him, and were sincere in expressions of regret. They knew of his immense fund of reserve force, and they relied on his cool head and clear brain in crisis. \\"It is only set-back,\\" they said, confidently; \\"we shall hear from you again.\\" He told them he did not know. One evening several weeks after his return, he and Charley Weston were alone in his room. \\"Charley,\\" he asked, \\"where is that letter from Jeff\'s daughter? had another to-day from her stepfather, saying her mother left her to me; named me her guardian ahem.\\" There was dry note in his voice. \\"I thought that was made very clear in the young lady\'s letter,\\" Weston said. \\"I did not so understand it, let me see it again was absorbed in other things at the time. Weston found him the letter, and for the third time Mr Felton read it, at last realizing the purport, and it was clear that the prospect it held forth was anything but satisfactory to him. He got up and walked restlessly about the room, stopped at the bookcase, selected book, from which he read sentence or two, and then put aside the volume. \\"It cannot be possible that she wants to come to me, Charley, and yet, what does she mean? She says she knows nothing of her father\'s family, and that she has but faint remembrance of him\\" he raised one shoulder impatiently. \\"I should like her more if she remembered Jeff better. Why did she not write before? Agnes has been dead nearly year. Poor Agnes! she had to go like any one else, somehow, thought she would live forever. He was silent for several moments, apparently in troubled thought, then said: \\"What do they expect of me? Do they want me to bring her here, to have young girl on my hands? That is out of the question. Charley, it is worse than being beat for Congress. Weston laughed. \\"I shall write to her, though, nice, friendly letter, and send her check. They say that is solace to most women.\\" \\"Now mind, Mr Felton, Charley said, as the older man seated himself at his desk, \\"you do not forget and think you are writing to constituent, and sending him some seed.\\" The congressman wrote slowly, laboriously. He stopped, and filled out check for liberal amount, then commenced again; he did not remember so serious task in an epistolary way. At last he drew long breath and looked up. \\"I think that will do,\\" he said. In bungling endeavor to dissuade her from coming, and to be polite at the same time, finesse foreign to most men, he had, without knowing it, sent her cordial invitation. The letter finished, he put on his hat and went out. \\"I suppose one always has to lie when dealing with women,\\" he said to himself; \\"I put down half dozen in that letter. But she is Jeff\'s daughter, and must make her feel welcome; She will not come. told her crusty old bachelor. If she should come he stopped and walked in another direction. \\"After that the deluge.\\" \\"What is the matter?\\" someone said, coming up and taking his arm from behind. \\"You are like one pursued by the furies.\\" \\"I do not know that am not,\\" Felton replied, and laughed short, hard laugh. \\"What sort of fury; woman?\\" The congressman assented. \\"Young and handsome?\\" \\"Both; know that she is young, and infer that she is handsome. She is my niece.\\" \\"That goes without saying,\\" his friend agreed, laughing. \\"Has your features doubt less good type for woman!\\" \\"Excellent,\\" smiling in spite of himself. \\"I never thought of her being like me. She is my brother\'s child her mother and father looked well. They are both dead, and she is left to me. What am to do with her, Hillyer?\\" He faced about squarely, and regarded his friend, grizzled army officer, seriously, questioningly. The two had been intimate for years, and Roger Hillyer thought he under stood Mr Felton better than that gentleman understood himself. \\"Do nothing; why, she will take care of herself. Bring woman to Washington, and engage she is entertained.\\" \\"But do not want to bring her here, my time is about out anyway.\\" \\"You will be in Congress next winter. do not know what shall do without you, old friend.\\" As Hillyer spoke, he held Felton\'s arm little closer. \\"Let her come now,\\" he went on, \\"and get the bearings, and next winter we will show her something of what is called life.\\" Major Hillyer seemed quite cheerful over the situation. \\"She may have to come for few weeks,\\" Mr Felton said, solemnly, \\"but next winter shall try,\\" he stopped lost in thought, \\"to send her to school.\\" Hillyer laughed. \\"What is her name?\\" \\"Viola Felton.\\" \\"Not from Los Angeles?\\" \\"Yes, from Los Angeles; my brother moved there years ago.\\" \\"I have met her,\\" Major Hillyer replied, with animation. \\"She was often at my cousin\'s house during my visit there last year, friend of her daughter. Why, my dear sir, she is beauty. have intended to ask if any of your people were out there. Send Viola Felton to school,\\" he laughed, \\"I think not.\\" He stopped and laughed again. \\"I must leave you now; am going to make call in here, unless you will come with me.\\" Mr Felton declined, he was in no mood for visiting. \\"Let me know when your niece arrives,\\" Hillyer said, resting his cane on the lower step of the house, and speaking with consoling interest. \\"My cousin, George Hillyer, was quite in love with her; you know he is stationed in Southern California now.\\" He mounted two steps, and then turned and asked with greater concern than he had yet shown: \\"Has Mr. Blake returned?\\" Felton said, \\"No,\\" and the major disappeared into one of the handsome residences on Connecticut Avenue. Mr Felton walked away. \\"And so have society young woman on my hands, he said aloud, and groaned. Viola was not slow to accept her uncle\'s invitation. \\"I shall leave Los Angeles Thursday,\\" she telegraphed, \\"will wire you en route.\\" Mr Felton kept her out of his mind as much as possible till the evening before her arrival. \\"Jeff\'s daughter will be here to-morrow,\\" he said to Weston. \\"Could you not see the proprietor, and arrange to make her comfort able?\\" Charley agreed, and immediately went down to the office of the hotel. \\"We can locate Miss Felton just opposite you here,\\" he said, returning rather sooner than Mr Felton expected. \\"Entirely too near, Charley; thought you would know that flight above or below would be much better.\\" \\"I know,\\" the younger man replied, twinkle in his eye, \\"but as you are her guardian, her chaperon, so to speak, thought it best to have her at least on the same floor,\\" and Weston laughed convulsively. \\"Damn it all, say, Charley,\\" Mr Felton cried and was silent. \\"Let us go for drive, he proposed later, \\"the wind in our faces will do us both good. The congressman kept thorough-bred Tennessee horses, and this afternoon whenever the road was clear and the stretch long enough he gave them full rein, talking to them the while, as though they were fractious children, for whom he entertained infinite toleration. All at once his good humor vanished, he pulled them down to walk, and turned their heads homeward. \\"You are going back early,\\" Weston said, feeling that the sudden change of speed and course required of him remark. \\"Yes,\\" he drove on listlessly, \\"I am anxious to get to town. The horses of their own accord quickened their pace. \\"You will meet Viola at the train?\\" he said at last, looking inquiringly at Weston. \\"If you desire it, with pleasure,\\" he replied \\"I am quite anxious to make Miss Felton\'s acquaintance; in sense, consider myself her guardian, too. But how shall find her, how know her possibly can\' manage it, how ever,\\" hopefully. \\"Maybe you cannot, and do not want her feelings hurt just at first, so shall go myself, but you must go with me.\\" The next morning found them both at the station. Mr Felton insisted on being there early, and gave himself fully half an hour to stride restlessly up and down the waiting room. He was in trouble; his quiet bachelor life was to be invaded, and that by young girl whose mother had done him great wrong, but she was his brother\'s child, and that fact must be considered. \\"This is poor business, Charley,\\" he said at last; \\"don\'t you think she would like to go to school?\\" His mind failed to take in any more feasible way to dispose of her. \\"You might marry her to me,\\" Weston said, boldly, relishing his chief\'s discomfiture. \\"I have taken many burden off your shoulders before, Mr Felton.\\" \\"Given the alternative she might prefer books. \\"Yes, higher education, possibly she is strong minded, and has views.\\" \\"God forbid,\\" was the fervent protest, and looking up he saw the train coming slowly into the station. The two stood\' and watched the people bustling out through the gates, but there was no one answering to their pre-conceived idea of Viola Felton. In crowd such as that, plain faces buzz out like bees; they are around you, about you, they are speaking to you and you regard them as matter of course. But comely folk make different impression there are fewer of them and they carry with them sort of distinction, sense of isolation. When nearly every one had passed, Weston uttered an exclamation, and said: \\"I think that is your niece, Mr Felton.\\" The latter looked, and saw slight, girlish figure dressed in mourning, coming toward him. She was closely veiled, but there was familiar air, family resemblance about her that he took in at glance. \\"This is my niece, Viola Felton, he said, stepping forward with an alacrity of which he had no idea. Weston saw there was no mistake, and dropped into the background. \\"And you are my Uncle Felton,\\" the girl said, taking his outstretched hands; then throwing back her veil, she held her face up to be kissed. \\"Bless my life,\\" he mentally ejaculated, as his lips touched her brow, half doubting whether he was pleased or not. But he looked down into the exquisite face, now very grave and white, and the faces known in his youth came back to him there were Jeff and Agnes, and Mary and Rans. \\"Come, my dear,\\" he said, brushing the mist from his eyes, and getting back to the present. And motioning to the porter who carried her bag, they made their way to the carriage awaiting them at the door. At first neither spoke, silence difficult to break had fallen between them. The light vehicle rolled rapidly over the smooth pavement, and the splendid sweep of Pennsylvania Avenue, the great parade ground of the nation, was seen by the young girl for the first time. It is the way over which presidents have gone to assume or lay off power, down which triumph ant armies have marched with waving flags and stirring music, and through which soldier, statesman, and president have been borne to the sound of muffled drum beats. \\"Did you have pleasant journey?\\" Mr Felton asked, finally. She had turned from looking at the Capitol, and was now facing the uncompromising position of the Treasury. \\"Yes, it was uneventful and without detention.\\" The low voice sounded familiar to him. \\"The first twenty-four hours was miserably tired, but seemed to rest these last few days.\\" \\"Did you have company?\\" She told him only part of the way. Mr Felton watched the new found niece very closely, wonderfully so for him, and more than once he smiled over the little family traits he recognized in her. Somehow, this morning he thought of his brother and not of Agnes. \\"Viola has her father\'s brow and open countenance,\\" he decided, \\"and the poise of her head is like his. Then he sighed, this elder brother had been his idea of fine gentle man in the boyhood days. To Viola, her uncle was revelation, he was not at all as she had imagined him to be. \\"But mamma never told me how he looked,\\" she thought. \\"Here he is almost young, handsome, distinguished-looking, when expected to find kind, but fossilized old bachelor.\\" Impulsively she looked up into his face. He was standing in the doorway of her room and would be gone in moment. \\"Your letter was so thoughtful, uncle,\\" she said, \\"that left Los Angeles almost immediately upon its receipt. did not realize till well under way what troublesome ward might be to you.\\" She scanned his face closely. \\"I have wondered, too,\\" speaking slowly, possibly anxiously, \\"if my telegram was not surprise, shock to you.\\" Mr Felton laughed outright. \\"Not at all, not at all,\\" smiling down into her face. \\"We shall get on well together, am sure. The idea of having niece with me was perplexing at first, but your father\'s child could never be anything but welcome. Why, my dear, have no one but you. did not think had any one till your letter came.\\" \\"Did you know of my existence?\\" \\"Yes, in vague way, and should have looked after you more. did once send letter asking if you needed anything, but it was not answered.\\" Viola did not reply. Resting his elbow on the door facing, he continued. \\"Agnes ought to have sent me word, shouldn\'t like for Jeff to see had neglected you. Do you think the spirits know, Viola?\\" \\"I suppose not,\\" she replied, little tremor coming into her voice, \\"yet it is comfort to feel that they are near. He regarded her earnestly for some moments, taking in every feature of her face. At last he spoke: \\"I am glad you have come, child,\\" laying his hand gently upon her arm. \\"I did not think should be, but am very glad. am set in my ways,\\" drawing his hand across his eyes, \\"and may not do all that should do, may forget you, become absorbed in other things, but remind me. I\'ll tell Weston to remind me, just as if were Jeff, your father, for want to take his place as nearly as possible.\\" Then, abrupt as usual, he left her and went into his own room. \\"Miss Felton is not nearly so bad as being defeated for Congress,\\" Charley Weston said one day as Viola, having walked with them part of the way to the capitol, left them. \\"No; there are mitigating circumstances. Charley,\\" turning upon his secretary and uttering his confidence involuntarily, \\"she is all Felton was afraid she would be like the other side. He made great speech that day in the House. It was upon bill bearing the name of distinguished senator, and tending to mitigate the financial condition of the country. The speaker\'s words were aggressive, strong, eloquent. When he had finished, his friends from both sides of the chamber crowded around his desk to shake his hand. That evening at dinner, very handsome woman entered the dining-room and came directly to the Felton table. She was study in soft white and filmy lace. She seemed made for the gown she wore, as the gown was for her. Every curve of her perfectly molded figure was brought out to the best advantage, every fold of the drapery fell in the most graceful way. Her hair was parted in the middle, and the natural waves were drawn back just escaping her pretty ears, into full light knot low on the back of her neck. She carried nothing in her hand, but walked in that \\"easy, indolent way she had, so confident of her charm.\\" Mr Felton rose with alacrity and offered his hand in pleased surprise. \\"Mr. Blake! How d\'ye do, madam. did not know you had returned. am glad to see you. Let me introduce my niece, Miss Felton.\\" The lady spoke to Viola and Weston, then turned to the congressman: \\"I heard your splendid speech to-day.\\" She allowed her pleasant voice to linger over the words. \\"Major Hillyer told me you might speak, and begged him to take me to the capitol. You know arrived this morning.\\" No, he did not know. \\"You should have felt my presence and gathered inspiration.\\" There was not the slightest haste in her utterance, every syllable was pronounced and given the most effective emphasis. \\"You say did well?\\" Her eyes smiled an assent. \\"Then credit it to your presence there this morning.\\" And he bowed in his most genial way. \\"I very much appreciate your going,\\" he added more seriously, \\"so much statistics and dry detail fear bored you.\\" \\"No; was glad to have the information; then your appeals for justice and right were very stirring.\\" He went with her to her seat, and they sat talking till her dinner was brought on. \\"How pretty your niece is. The Feltons are strongly marked race.\\" This last was added inconsequently. He passed his hand up and d6wn his face, then drew it across his chin. \\"I think Viola looks like my people,\\" he replied, losing sight of the implied compliment. \\"And that pleases you. believe have heard that you did not enjoy her mother\'s family.\\" He was silent. \\"Possibly should not have spoken,\\" soothingly, \\"but you will not be offended with me such good friends as we are. Come to my parlor to-night,\\" she urged, as he moved away. \\"Major Hillyer will be there, besides, want to discuss some points in your speech to-day that did not quite understand.\\" No, he was not offended with Mr. Blake he may have realized that the remark was not in that very tactful woman\'s usual taste, and he may unconsciously have winced at the thought of any one\'s knowing that his relations with his brother\'s family were not of the closest, but he would go in to see her that evening. She had evidently listened to his speech with great attention and intelligence. His interest in his niece and his idea of duty in regard to her manifested itself in the desire to have her see the sights. He wished her to go through the government buildings (did not all newcomers to the city do the same?), to look out upon the world from the top of the monument, and to climb the many winding flights of steps to the dome of the capitol, this last if the weather should be propitious, that meant, cool enough for the exertion. \\"We must go down the river,\\" he had said several times to Weston, and repeated it this morning at breakfast. \\"I wish Viola to see the Potomac.\\" The secretary, who was rattling the ice in his cantaloupe, looked up much amused. \\"I shall never more doubt the fellowship of ideas,\\" he exclaimed, smiling across the table at Viola. \\"Major Hillyer has just been in, and he and Mr. Blake suggest that we all go to Mount Vernon to-day.\\" Mr Felton considered moment. \\"Yes, can go,\\" he said, thoughtfully; \\"you know there is no session, and my other matters can be left over. You would like to go?\\" questioningly to Viola. The young girl was charmed with the prospect. Weston dispatched his meal as rapidly as possible. \\"I will make all the arrangements,\\" he said, leaving the table in advance of them. \\"Weston is my right arm,\\" Mr Felton ex claimed, casting good-natured look after the young man as he left the breakfast room. \\"Who is uncle\'s friend?\\" Viola spoke sotto voce to Major Hillyer. The whole party except Mr Felton were together on the deck of the steamer Corcoran that was just moving off from the pier. \\"I heard him say as we passed,\\" she continued, \\"that he had come on the river to get cool. The major glanced across the boat where Mr Felton stood in jocular conversation with gentleman. The latter was holding great English mastiff by the collar. \\"Ah, Carston!\\" he said with much satisfaction. \\"A young member from the South,\\" regarding Viola quizzically, \\"that is young enough, talented, good-looking, quite swell. He even passes muster before the army and navy Shall present him?\\" Viola laughed. \\"A gentleman with so many attractions should not get warm,\\" she said. \\"He is still under the domination of nature, the major replied, joining in her merriment, \\"but his character is perfecting in congressional atmosphere, and he may grow angelic and escape from it.\\" \\"Hush,\\" Mr. Blake exclaimed, warningly, \\"here they are.\\" Her remark was none too soon for the major saw with alarm that in moment Philip Carston\'s alert ears would have caught his words. \\"Carston is fine fellow,\\" Mr Felton said. After introducing the young man to Viola, he had moved round and joined Mr. Blake. \\"Yes, decidedly so,\\" was the reply. \\"Looking at those two now,\\" meaning Viola and Carston, \\"the instinct of the match-maker is aroused within me.\\" The congressman was amused. \\"In the effort for some one else you would ensnare the victim yourself,\\" he said, gallantly. great gust of wind just then took off his hat, and he had to rush after it to keep it from going overboard. When they were well under way, Carston sought seat near Viola, but he was not sure that he wanted to talk. He felt it would be pleasant just idly to drift away from Washington down the beautiful Potomac in silence. He had said that he was glad to meet her, and had pointed out Arlington as they passed, but she did not seem loquacious herself, so in sort of tacit sympathy they watched the water, and listened to the dull throb of the boat. Her gaze was still upon the broad sweep of the river, and he suddenly became conscious of the exquisite beauty of her profile. \\"How long have you been in the city, Miss Felton?\\" he asked, abruptly, sitting erect and showing disposition to talk. Her very blue eyes turned to him from the river, and it seemed to Carston that they had caught their color from the waters, blue and shimmering in the full sunlight. \\"Only few weeks, she replied. \\"I had not heard of your being here. It is rather bad time to come to Washington.\\" \\"I came to be with my uncle.\\" Carston laughed musically, pleasantly. \\"I never suspected him of having niece,\\" he said, \\"but he is man of magnificent surprises, there is no telling what brilliant feat he may accomplish next. You, yourself, have been the compensation for his defeat for Congress, and now the news comes from his state that he will be sent to the Senate.\\" \\"Uncle Felton has not told me,\\" she exclaimed. \\"I am very glad. think politics suit him, that he would not be himself out of office.\\" The boat puffed into and away from Alexandria and they stopped talking to watch the sleepy, old Virginia town. \\"Mr Felton will be felt wherever he may be,\\" Carston said, taking up the conversation where they had left off; \\"he is by nature leader, does his own thinking, keeps his own counsel he has few equals in the House. Of late,\\" smiling significantly, \\"I fancy he is becoming interested well in sentimental way. Viola glanced at her uncle and Mr. Blake, who sat not far away in earnest conversation, and looked thoughtful. \\"You are not pleased,\\" Carston said with conviction. \\"I do not understand,\\" she replied. \\"Or will not,\\" he said, \\"none of you women like rival. Why would not Mr. Blake make nice sort of aunt?\\" \\"I am sure cannot say, know her very slightly.\\" The young girl was annoyed; she had no intention of being confidential with an entire stranger. \\"Where is your home, Miss Felton?\\" She smiled involuntarily. \\"Here or in Tennessee, am with my uncle. had thought until your pleasant suggestion about the Senate, that hereafter it would be Tennessee. You see I, too, am in the hands of the dear people.\\" Then they were conscious of the grating of the boat as it touched at Mount Vernon, and Charley Weston came to say that they had reached their journey\'s end. \\"I was just telling Miss Felton that did not know you possessed so gentle representative as herself,\\" Phillip Carston said to Mr Felton, as he and Viola fell in line behind that gentleman and Mr. Blake, and they all began the ascent of the long graveled walk to the Mansion. \\"A fact much to my credit,\\" the congress man replied, his face relaxing pleasantly. \\"We are going home to Tennessee, Viola and I. How much longer do you think the session will last?\\" \\"Only few weeks surely.\\" They spent the day much as all tourists at Mount Vernon spend it. They followed the crowd through the house, heard the oft told tale from the guide whose voice never grows weary; they visited the flower gardens, and came away laden with bloom. They sat upon the lawn, and spoke of the old times, of what  Washington did in his day, and the change and improvement of the onward march of civilization, the quickened pulse of thought, the swift flight of speech the comfort of travel by sea and land, of this splendid age that does not make people any better, nor statesmen any purer, nor the plane of government any higher. Mr Felton said Mount Vernon was \\"the green tent where the republic put its armor on. There came to them thoughts commonplace enough thoughts that have been expressed so often there that they seem very denizens of the place while the river wound in silver at their feet, as it moved onward to the sea. \\"All\'s quiet along the Potomac.\\" The evening shadows lay upon the river, the impetuous, blinding glare of the sun had gone, and there came something invigorating and fine in the strong breeze that rushed into people\'s faces, made miniature sails of ribbons and veils, blew handkerchiefs about like white caps, and caused hats and even bonnets to be subjects for accident policies. The Corcoran was nearing Washington. It made its way through the silvery stretch of waters with the great trailing foam behind it, moving steadily, peacefully, and gradually slowing up as the domes and monuments of the city came into view. Dark clouds were massed over in the west, and just below them the sun looked out for moment glowing disc, as large as cart wheel of gold. Mr Felton found Mr. Blake an agreeable companion, there was in her presence an attraction for him. But once when her soft gray eyes gazed up earnestly into his face, there came to him another woman\'s eyes, gray and beautiful, that were part of his youth. Involuntarily he sighed. \\"I was thinking or dreaming,\\" he explained in answer to her look of inquiry. \\"O, the young hearts, the glad spring time!\\" They were entering the hotel, and the conversation was broken off, but he saw that she had mistaken his words for gallantry, and the fact struck him with surprise not unmixed with pleasure. Long ago he had put love and marriage out of his thought, but \\"why not, why not?\\" The question came to him to-day in serious light. They found her parlor door ajar, and upon her urgent invitation he went in. Mr. Blake spent most of her time in the city, and there was consequently much individuality in her apartments. The parlor was in summer effects white muslin curtains of the sheerest material, and looped back with the daintiest of blue ribbons, adorned the windows. The furniture was covered in white linen except two or three gilt wicker chairs that were scattered about the room. water color with ships in the distance and an atmosphere of cool sea breeze was in white enameled frame, and resting on an easel of the same material. There was also over the marble mantel larger picture by French artist, evidently of considerable value. It represented young girl lying almost at full length amidst very green grass, while wild flowers, pink, scarlet, purple, and blue were thrown, piled up all about her. They were in her hair, on her bosom, indeed the whole form except one exquisitely molded arm that rested carelessly above the head, was discovered through the riot of bloom. On the table upon handsome piece of embroidery stood bowl filled with summer annuals, phlox, petunias, and nasturtiums. \\"Except for week or ten days at time always remain in the city,\\" Mr. Blake had told him; \\"I shudder at the thought of solitude, quiet, and nature. want the full tide of human life always about me.\\" She gave him the best chair in the room, unfurled large fan and placed it beside him, and brought him glass of water, standing by his side while he drank it. \\"This is pleasant place,\\" he said, glancing about the room as though it rested his eyes; \\"why is it that you always have the best things about you?\\" \\"Not always,\\" she replied. \\"I am more fortunate than usual to-day.\\" He laughed in spite of himself, and shifted his position to bring her within the line of his vision. Mr. Blake had laid aside her bonnet and gloves and was standing by the center table, her hand moving slowly around the brim of his hat. \\"Of what are you thinking?\\" he demanded abruptly, startled by the expression of her face. With swift motion she came and sat beside him. \\"Of what you said of the young hearts and the glad spring time.\\" If she had intended it to be so her words were well timed. She had never so fascinated him. \\"Our hearts are not light like they used to be, Clara?\\" He spoke gently, and took the small white hand in his firm clasp. \\"The past, how bitter it is,\\" she exclaimed, \\"bitter! terrible! And life is never the same again. She left him and went to the window resting her head against the pane. Mr Felton looked about him helplessly, and then got up and followed her. \\"I rarely give way like this,\\" she said, calming herself with an effort and smiling up into his face, \\"but sometimes waves of feeling arise and submerge all else even reason and judgment.\\" They went back to their seats, and she began to talk upon other subjects, politics, finance, or any question that she deemed of interest to him. But she failed to hold his attention; Mr. Blake, herself, was occupying his whole thought. That this splendid woman should be so moved troubled him. His mind ran swiftly back through the period (not very long) of their acquaintance. She might have had grief, but only mistakes, wrong, were bitter. He dismissed the thought impatiently there could be nothing in her past the remembrance of which should so overwhelm her of this he was sure she was only nervous to-day. He answered her questions almost at random, and was only conscious that he had spoken at all, when he found himself declaring that his party would be defeated in the approaching presidential election. \\"No, no,\\" he said in alarm, \\"I do not believe that at all. spoke without appreciating your remark, in fact was thinking of something else. He arose to go. \\"What have seen this afternoon distresses me greatly,\\" he continued awkwardly. \\"You are so interesting, so clever, you give others so much pleasure that he stopped. \\"I had fancied you were always happy, always content. wish could,\\" he began impulsively, then stopped again. \\"I wish you to know,\\" he concluded miserably, \\"that you have my sympathy and help in whatever fortune may come to you.\\" And he left her feeling like man who had made poor, inappropriate speech. \\"The affair grows apace, the widow is to the fore,\\" Weston whispered to Carston as his chief, having kept them waiting an hour for dinner, entered the room. \\"It looks that way,\\" was Carston\'s smiling reply. All through the meal Mr Felton was distrait and silent; he could not enter into the wit and raillery that was rife about the table, he was unfit for it, it jarred upon his over-wrought nerves. And when Carston told him that \\"good few\\" congressmen would meet that night at Habner\'s to sit about the table, drink beer, and listen to the music, he shook his head. \\"I cannot go,\\" he declared, \\"they say they keep cool down there, but it is mistake. do not feel like it anyway. Then,\\" with an attempt at joke, \\"I have had enough gayety for one day. There is Hillyer now,\\" the major was standing in the door, \\"he and will move our chairs out in front of the hotel and get through the evening all right.\\" \\"Hillyer, has Mr. Blake\'s life been very sad one?\\" For half an hour Mr Felton had been trying to ask this question. But Carston stayed with them till he left to keep the appointment at Habner\'s; then Charley Weston rushed up to tell of fine horse having been killed by dashing in front of car. Besides many of the habitues, hangers on, of the hotel had stopped for word with the two friends, and reporter had demanded an item of news, either political or army. But every one had now gone, and the way was clear for private conversation. The question, or was it the shadows of the night, made the major very thoughtful. He did not answer with his usual promptness. \\"Yes,\\" hesitatingly, \\"she has passed through great deal, and there has been some criticism, much talk. But,\\" he broke out impulsively, \\"I have known Clara Deane from her childhood, and braver, nobler woman does not breathe.\\" \\"What talk? What criticism?\\" his companion demanded, laconically. \\"I do not like to speak of it, Felton, as few people in this part of the country know her history, but if you insist, of course acceding to Mr Felton\'s half-uttered protest you know she was unhappily married. It is long story, but this is the summary: Her husband was handsome, dissipated, fashionable young man about town, who neglected her shame fully, and with gambling and carousals, was rapidly running through with her inheritance, originally very large estate. Her friends persuaded her to leave him. The news that she had instituted proceedings for divorce came to Blake suddenly. He rushed to her lawyer, young man of great promise, and receiving no satisfaction shot him dead in his office, and then put bullet through his own worthless brain. Blake\'s family, an influential one, is very bitter against his wife.\\" Major Hillyer had spoken with considerable energy, though his voice was low and deep almost to gruffness. \\"Murder! Suicide!\\" Mr Felton exclaimed, starting back as though he had received blow. There was little else said. The major crushed the evening paper in his hand and threw it away, and Mr Felton looked out into the night, up at the stars, he even calculated how long it would take the moon to be lost behind the building across the way, and as he did so, the cigar slowly went out in his hand. II Congress had at last adjourned, and Mr Felton and his niece were going home to Tennessee. Home did not mean much to Viola, she was to look upon new scenes, to meet new people. The evening before their departure, Carston came in much as usual, yet the visit did not seem the same to either him or Viola. She was going away, he was going away their paths divided, the pleasant season together was over. \\"You go to-morrow?\\" he said. The parlor was running over with Mr Felton\'s books and boxes, so they sought refuge on the veranda. The moon was at the full. fresh breeze swept down the street, hunted them out and made them glad of its coming. \\"Yes, by the morning train, Uncle Felton is impatient to get away.\\" \\"And are you anxious to go?\\" He leaned forward that he might drink in more the beauty of her face. \\"I? no,\\" she said, hurriedly, and was silent. \\"And I,\\" he murmured, \\"would be glad to stay just where we are, or anywhere, so we might be together. \\"— \'And Thou Beside me singing in the wilderness, Oh, Wilderness were Paradise now.\' Omar Khayyam\'s words came from him slowly, contemplatively. Viola trembled with excitement, but she looked out into the night and was conscious of the electric lights making stations in the streets and of the moon\'s pale insistence. \\"How beautiful you are,\\" he said; \\"have many told you so, Viola? If not they have never seen the moonlight on your face, and in your hair.\\" He put up his hand and touched the glistening sheen. \\"There is witchery about it, or you have bewitched me.\\" It was supreme moment, but like so many other supreme moments, they did not know. band passed playing gayly in the street below. She was nervous and leaned over the railing to see it, and spoke of the music, of the old familiar airs, and the spell was partially broken. Then there came the sound of moving boxes in her uncle\'s rooms, and that gentleman\'s voice, coldly practical, giving instructions concerning them, and sending messages, two or three, to the office, to have his party called at an early hour the next morning. Mr Felton was restless, and moved about aimlessly from room to room. He felt like hurrying Weston and Viola every moment, he declared to them more than once that they were sure to be left. \\"Ask Miss Felton if her baggage is in condition to be sent down to-night,\\" he said to the man who had taken his official documents and literature to be stored, and had returned to receive liberal fee. This, too, despite Viola\'s assertion half an hour before that her trunks were not ready, but she would have them on time. Carston became discouraged, irritated. \\"There is no opportunity for conversation,\\" he said, \\"I am going.\\" If the young girl was disappointed she gave no sign, and they stepped together through the open window into her uncle\'s parlor. \\"You are not leaving, Carston?\\" Mr Felton asked, \\"I wish to discuss with you the advantages of this bill to our people.\\" The young man looked weary. \\"I am not equal to it to-night,\\" he replied; \\"in fact am not hopeful of the result. These com promise measures often fail all along the line. \\"You are not well,\\" disappointed at the lack of interest that was more manifest in Carston\'s manner than words, \\"are pulled down some, think. You ought to get out of town. Do you go to-morrow?\\" \\"Not till the day following. shall be still more anxious to leave when you all are gone. The city is getting like furnace,\\" he smiled faintly, \\"as the newspaper paragrapher says, \'genius should take to the woods.\' Mr Felton laughed. \\"That will make city gentleman of you permanently, fear.\\" \\"I have been uneasy about it,\\" Carston retorted, \\"but have thought what good time my friends are going to have.\\" When the Feltons reached the station next morning the waiting rooms were crowded. Residents were leaving the city, seeking health and pleasure by the sea or in the mountains, and members of both houses of Congress were returning home to spend what was left of the summer with their constituents. There were knots of men in cheerful conversation; there were hearty handshakings; and many good words and good wishes were uttered. An old member from the West came up and patted very correctly appearing Bostonian upon the shoulder, and laughed gleefully over point he thought he had scored on him, and the gentleman from Massachusetts seemed to enter fully into his spirit of merrymaking. There were apparently no party and no creed, they were all friends this morning, or school boys off on an outing. As the Boston man left the member from Colorado he caught sight of Mr Felton. \\"Come to the Senate, Felton,\\" he said, \\"I do not think any of your people will do so well.\\" \\"I shall try, but the woods down there are full of bigger men than am.\\" \\"I do not believe word of it,\\" and they parted. Carston saw Mr Felton and his niece enter the station and waved to them over the heads of half dozen men, and in his eagerness to get in closer proximity, stepped on the toe of small boy, who sent up an unearthly howl. \\"I thought you would never come,\\" he said to Viola, reaching her side at last. \\"A gentleman detained uncle on business, and,\\" smiling significantly, \\"we took longer farewell of Mr. Blake than thought necessary. am very sorry.\\" He found her seat and himself one beside her. But railway station is poor place for conversation; it is full of shifting scenes, of bathos, or pathos, of business, of pleasure, of necessity, of luxury, of rush, and push, and hurry; while over all the humdrum, monotony of life sweeps like current. \\"Only few moments more,\\" Carston said, glancing vindictively at the great clock, \\"and had hoped to talk with you, but there is no time for anything except to know that you are going.\\" He rose to his feet, \\"Your uncle and Weston are beckoning to us now,\\" he said. Almost on the instant came the call \\"All aboard for Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia.\\" Carston went with them to the car, helped to find their seats, then there was hurried good-by, and he stood alone on the platform, and watched the train moving rapidly away. Ah, love but day And the world has changed, The sun\'s away,  And the birds estranged; The wind has dropped, And the sky\'s deranged: Summer has stopped.\\" In this city pre-eminently of change, how many good-bys have been said. People go off merrily or regretfully, and pass from the life they have loved, the friends they have enjoyed. New scenes, new thoughts, new duties fill up and make the future. So many pleasant faces fade from view, and some times many uncongenial ones are to the fore, that as environment is to life what color is to picture, after time the individuals are not the same at all. \\"Viola, come sit by the window,\\" said Mr Felton to his niece the morning of the second day\'s journey, \\"I want you to see the country. This is Tennessee,\\" he looked out upon the fields past which they were flying and his face glowed with pleasure. \\"1 like the appearance of everything about the state.\\" From Knoxville on, people he knew began getting on the train, and he was continually going into the day coach to talk with them. More than that when he saw friend standing at the station he would hurry to the door to have word with him. \\"It is like was at home; have heard all  the news,\\" he said to Weston; and later, \\"They tell me they have very promising crops,\\" or \\"Old Mr Meadows gave me fine watermelon back there, Charley. We must have the porter cut it for us. wish Viola to see how much better we raise them here than anywhere else.\\" \\"I expect he got it from Georgia,\\" man across the car said with laugh. This fellowtraveler, evidently not Tennesseean, was much amused over Mr Felton\'s enthusiasm. \\"No, it is Tennessee grown,\\" was the reply, \\"and insist that you try piece,\\" passing some of the ripe, pink heart to the traducer of his state. Charley Weston saw and understood his chief\'s elation the latter had heard good news in regard to the legislative tickets. All the day coaches were crowded after they left Cowan, and Mr Felton spent little time with his niece. Many politicians were on the train, going to the gubernatorial convention, and he was with them, hearing the state news, and the prospects of the several candidates. The Felton homestead was typical Southern house of the old, ante-bellum style, built of brick and stucco. broad, beautiful hall ran through the building, on either side of which were large rooms, whose high ceilings and many windows invited the breeze, and were sure of the draught. The porch extending across the front was supported by Corinthian columns, architecture very familiar to all in the Southland. This property had been sold for debt long ago, but as matter of sentiment, was bought back by the present proprietor as soon as he could afford it. He became sad and retrospective at the thought of establishing home there now. But he said to Weston, \\"I see nothing else for me to do, as may be here permanently and have Viola.\\" \\"This is pleasant place for the summer time,\\" he said to his niece as they stood together and looked out upon the lawn that stretched green and beautiful to the stone fence separating it from the turnpike. These stone fences, picturesque boundaries, wind here and there in long deviating ways through middle Tennessee they are relic of the days when the people hastened slowly, and built dominated by the idea of stability. Yes, it was pleasant place; Viola listened to the wind as it swept in cadence through the great forest trees; she heard the mocking bird\'s call from wild grapevine that had completely submerged tree near by; her eye swept onward over the beautiful Blue Grass country, and she knew why the people loved it so. \\"Will it not be pleasant all the year?\\" she asked. \\"I was speaking of the house,\\" he replied; \\"I fear there will be too much draught for you in mid-winter, for myself like fresh air, there is sense of suffocation in heated halls, and over-heated rooms.\\" Except for spoiling the beauty of the hall, Viola said, practically, \\"a stove would be very comfortable. \\"I should like fireplace much better (Mr Felton had all Southern man\'s antipathy to stove), but there is time enough for that.\\" He turned and walked slowly through the hall and entered his study. He carried the morning mail in his hands, but he had looked it over on the porch and there seemed nothing in it of special interest to him. \\"I suppose must go to some of these places to which they invite me,\\" he thought, slipping the cards back into some diminutivesized envelopes and laying them aside. He placed his hand to his head. This social duty, as he considered it, had come to be serious objection to his being householder and having niece in society. \\"There has always been good deal of gayety here in summer,\\" he took up the thought and went on reasoning it out to himself. \\"It is just as it was when was growing up everybody has guests house parties they call them now and wants to entertain them,\\" he smiled grimly, \\"and because of Viola, must go and see it done.\\" But the congressman was interested in other things; he could not devote much time to this folderol, as he termed it. The nominee of his party for governor would be in the city within the next few days, and some fitting demonstration must be arranged in his honor. The committee waited on Mr Felton and they agreed upon torch-light procession, as large and enthusiastic as could be got together, after which the candidate would speak at the opera house, and then there would follow an informal reception. \\"Of course, you will introduce our next governor,\\" the chairman said, heartily. Mr Felton agreed to this, then added: \\"We must have the occasion worthy of our guest and of ourselves. Our town should not fall one whit behind its old-time record when it shouted for Jackson, Polk, Bell, and the rest. Let us have grand rally.\\" The opera house was crowded to its utmost capacity. Upon the stage there were many flowers, and the arch above it was decorated with flags and bunting. In the audience sat many handsomely gowned women, their fans fluttering to and fro while they discussed politics and predicted the success of their candidates. Strains of music came in through the open windows, and cheer upon cheer was heard from the procession carrying the transparencies and torches, and gradually massing about the building. Some of the most unique and amusing of the caricatures were brought in, and amid clapping of hands, placed in positions to be seen. Seated upon the stage were prominent citizens, the city officials, legislative candidates, and slightly to the front were Judge Justice, Mr Felton, and the nominee for governor. The noise continued to roll in like the roar of great swelling wave, and the clapping of hands and stamping of feet began; the audience were impatient with long waiting. In concluding his speech of introduction, Mr Felton said he was reminded of time more than twenty-five years before, when he and the party\'s nominee stood on the banks of the little river just outside their city and hurled stones into the waters below. \'I do not desire life of ephemeral beauty like that, my friend said, pointing to the peaks of churned foam that caught and flashed back the sun\'s rays. \'My ambition is to achieve something of benefit to the world, to become of service to the commonwealth my fathers helped to build.\' The boy\'s dream is near fulfillment! After November it will be reality.\\" The reception that followed the speaking had been in progress more than half an hour, and Mr Felton was looking about him for some means of escape. \\"I have been here long enough and no one will miss me.\\" He edged his way gradually toward the door and had nearly reached it when Judge Justice\'s genial voice called him to the duties of the occasion. \\"Felton, you have not met my cousin, Miss Vane,\\" he said, \\"and Margaret tells me she must know all the lions to-night. You were just running off,\\" the judge added, with laugh, \\"I see it in your eye.\\" Mr Felton responded cordially to the introduction, and mendaciously disclaimed all thought of leaving, no matter how long the handshaking continued. Then, he scarcely knew how it came about, he was soon making the circuit of the rooms with Miss Vane, and Judge Justice was back with the guest of honor. To his surprise he enjoyed the conversation that followed. His companion talked brilliantly. She had informed herself upon politics, was conversant with current literature, and, something rarely to be met with in so young woman, knew the old standard authors. \\"A very fine girl,\\" he mentally ejaculated more than once. Instinctively he felt that he did not make her appear old, she made him feel young. When they separated, he told her that their conversation had given him much pleasure. \\"Come out and see Viola, stay some with her,\\" he insisted in his cordial, Southern way. And Margaret Vane gladly accepted the invitation.  Mr Felton was smoking his cigar on the front porch at home. He had just finished his breakfast and had pulled his light wooden chair so that his range could extend farthest over the grounds, he thought there were pretty shadows on the lawn in the morning. \\"Down there in the elm is where Jeff and robbed the dove\'s nest,\\" he remembered; \\"the poor bird gave such mournful cry, can almost hear it now. When mother knew of our sin she punished us,\\" he laughed inwardly, \\"by not letting us go fishing for two days.\\" He puffed away at his cigar. \\"And the rock spring house! I\'ve never got it to look like it So did in mother\'s time. The water has never seemed so cool, nor the melons put in it so good. The giant elm that grew over it has dwarfed and they all seem much nearer to the house. It used to take many steps, when my legs were short, to get there.\\" Viola came out and drew her chair beside him. \\"Uncle, Mr Feltonmet came back pleasant to the lady present last night.\\" regret fully. \\"She seemed glad to know me, said she remembered mamma and papa, too; she is related somehow, believe; did not quite understand the connection mean Mr. Rans; she asked me to come to see her.\\" \\"Ahem,\\" Mr Felton replied, slowly. \\"Yes, Mr. Rans is your cousin.\\" \\"She is very attractive,\\" Viola continued, with enthusiasm, \\"sad looking, think. She must have been beauty when she was young. \\"I believe she was called so.\\" He ex tended his chin and drew his lips together firmly. \\"I did not like Mr Rans so well. He stuck out his hand and said, \'How d\'ye do,\' and no more. As they left heard him say to his wife, \'Felton\'s niece, eh?\' \\"And she said?\\" I did not hear her reply. Oh, he is not to be compared with Herbert and his mother.\\" \\"Who is Herbert?\\" Mr Felton was leaning forward. \\"Why, Herbert Rans, their only child. Do you not know him, Uncle Felton? He is young lawyer, just back from Princeton, and very delicate. The poor fellow broke blood vessel, or strained his chest in some way in wrestling match at college. want you to see him, you would like him, think.\\" The young girl failed to appreciate how dis tasteful the conversation was to her listener. \\"I do not want to know him, Viola,\\" shortly; \\"I am sorry you have met any of them. The Ranses are miserable stock.\\" He moved restlessly in his seat, the beauty, the color of the morning had gone. \\"Not Herbert,\\" Viola declared aggressively, \\"I know few people better than he, and his mother,\\" she added. Mr Felton gave nervous, impatient gesture, and walked away. Of all those whom she had met, he thought, why had his niece settled upon Rans\'s son. He looked far away to the hills. This family seemed to be hounding his footsteps for evil, he clinched his fist, and he might not be through with it till the bitter end. Mr Felton was dreamer but when aroused to the necessity for action no one was more practical, more aggressive, or more effective than he. He had heard the whistle of the train during his conversation with Viola, and now the boy brought him the Nashville papers. He read the \\"American\\" through carefully, noting the dispatches, the general news, the trend of popular thought, and endeavored to estimate the strength of his party. He determinately kept his mind on the pages before him; he even informed himself as to the condition of the crops and the prospect of the farmers and stock raisers. About ten o\'clock he ordered his horse and rode to town. Viola was much disturbed over what Mr Felton said in regard to the Rans family. These old feuds, she decided, were very troublesome and unnecessary. With pang she remembered her mother\'s having once said that her Uncle Felton was good hater, relentless, bitter. The young girl had found Herbert Rans more attractive than any one whom she had met in the new home. He was handsome, with great gray eyes, deep and sad, rather scholarly, and thoroughly appreciative of her own fascinations no one is dull whose taste is perfect! And, despite her conscience-formed resolutions as to loyalty and duty, when he came to call upon her she welcomed him cordially. fresh wind had sprung up and was singing song in the trees great drifts of clouds were flying like white sails across the face of the moon. Down by the big gate the lawn was in deepest shadows, while on the rise of the grounds to the east there was shifting light regulated by the clouds and the moon, now it was almost day, and again it became wan, disturbing glow. This evening Viola was intensely sensitive to her surroundings. She had been so little used to the country that on such night as this it awed and troubled her; her thoughts turned to things ghostly and uncanny. \\"I am glad to see you,\\" she said to Herbert, \\"I was lonely, oppressed by the shadows and the moon,\\" she pointed up the turnpike to great, bold rock just off the road, that seemed lifted from the chasm below. About this there was neighborhood ghost story. \\"Everything is so strange and weird that almost fancy can see old Spencer riding through the silver light.\\" \\"I hope may be able to chase the ghosts and shadows away,\\" he replied, taking seat by her side. \\"For myself, like these summer nights, the rustle of the trees, the mocking-bird\'s note, and now and then the solemn hoot of the owl.\\" \\"Oh, the owls!\\" she cried, lifting her hands in horror, \\"they are terrible; one in that tree out there sometimes keeps me awake half the night. have bribed the gardener to kill them all.\\" Herbert laughed. \\"How relentless you women are, you would destroy the whole race for nervous tremor.\\" \\"Not that; but nature is so sentient, so teeming with life in the summer time that it oppresses one; see the continued bustle and struggle for existence, the strong warring on and living off the weak, all the way up the scale.\\" \\"You are not pastoral, you do not appreciate the country,\\" he said; \\"you may love nature in its height, in its gigantic effort, but the fields, the woods, are on too level plane for you. And yet, there is nothing finer as country than this; it seems so to me the cli mate, the bold springs gushing from the rocks, the beautiful extended views, the fine horses, the people everything, like. It is God\'s land to me.\\" \\"You all feel that way,\\" Viola said; \\"my uncle does pre-eminently, and would like anything for his sake.\\" This was said as sop to her conscience. \\"Are you so fond of him, then?\\" \\"Yes, he is more to me than any one in the world.\\" Herbert seemed somewhat disturbed. \\"I am sorry he was not returned to Congress.\\" \\"Yes?\\" she said slowly, questioningly. He looked up quickly. \\"Why do you say yes in that way?\\" \\"Because he owes his defeat to your father. There was short silence between them, into which there entered the sound of horse\'s hoofs coming up the drive, and Viola knew her uncle or Charley Weston had returned. \\"Only partially, trust,\\" he said finally, \\"I know father opposed him, am sorry he did. regretted it before, he was credit to the district, do particularly since knowing you.\\" As she did not reply, he added, \\"I was away at the time. Had been at home, might have influenced my father. They have never been friends, do not know why.\\" \\"They could never have been they are very different,\\" Viola said, decidedly, and little aggressively. \\"Yes my father is man of great worth, Miss Felton. him,\\" inclined she to said reply. dryly. \\"Do you mean to criticize my father to me?\\" he demanded quickly; his voice showed decided irritation. \\"This is free country, man is at liberty to support whom he pleases, know my father did what was right. \\"You will excuse my not agreeing with you,\\" haughtily; \\"no one is right in my eyes who opposes my uncle. did not know of this till recently. \\"Otherwise, infer, should not have the honor of your friendship. Do you propose to confine it to your uncle\'s political followers?\\" with sneer. \\"Am unreasonable in that?\\" she gasped. \\"You must decide for yourself. Good evening, Miss Felton. \\"Do not go like that,\\" she said, following him, and extending her hand; \\"we have been such friends are such friends.\\" He came back up the steps and took her hand. \\"Good-by,\\" he said, then catching the one that hung by her side, he drew them both to his face. For an instant the cool palms lay against his cheek, he pressed them to his lips, and turning went rapidly down the walk. Herbert did not stop to open the gate, but put his hands on the fence, and leaped over it as he used to do when he was strong and well. Once out on the turnpike, which looks so weird in the moonlight as it threads the country like great artery, everything seemed freer to him. He threw back his head and shoulders, drew in long breath, and walked on furiously. It was past twelve o\'clock when he reached home, but his mother was up waiting for him. \\"What has kept you, my son?\\" she asked, anxiously, \\"you know how careful you should be.\\" \\"I went to make call, and then walked home possibly did not come the most direct route.\\" His voice was tired, he looked weary and fagged out. \\"You have been walking through the fields,\\" she said, in alarm, \\"your feet are wet with dew, and,\\" going nearer, \\"great beads of perspiration are on your brow. What is the matter, Herbert?\\" \\"Nothing,\\" he replied, wearily, \\"you are right, am miserably tired. Mother, to-night sort of recklessness seized me, determined not to be an invalid any longer. put my hand on the fence and vaulted over it. felt strong as used to feel. started in my old swinging pace up the road, there was excitement, there was solace in it. did not get far; this pain,\\" laying his hand on his chest, \\"struck me like rifle ball, and had to creep home slowly as best could that is why am so late. Mother,\\" desperately, \\"we may as well not cheat ourselves, cannot be patient and get well. want to be strong as other men, to be sick like child, or woman it is terrible!\\" He lay down on the lounge in the hall, and pressed his hand over his lungs. \\"You are out of spirits to-night, darling,\\" she said, pushing back the hair from the beautiful brow so like her own, \\"this will help you,\\" and she held cordial to his lips. \\"You have overtaxed your strength, you will be your own brave self in the morning.\\" She went with him to his room, arranged the pillows, shut off the draught, and made him as comfortable as possible. When he was nearly asleep, his mother sitting beside him, they were both startled by Mr Rans\'s voice in the room. \\"Herbert is not sick, is he, Mary?\\" \\"He is very tired, and does not feel so well.\\" Mr Rans came up close beside her, and said, in low whisper, \\"Any hemorrhage?\\" She shook her head. He looked relieved, then he put out his. puffy Hand, and placed it on Herbert\'s brow. \\"Slight fever,\\" he said, \\"he must have the doctor in the morning. Do not fail to send for him, Mary. might get him here to-night,\\" as Herbert moved restlessly. \\"I think it will not be necessary to-night, besides there is no one to send James is sick, and Jacob has gone to the campmeeting, Mr. Rans replied. \\"I can go myself. should not mind going at all cannot sleep anyway.\\" \\"You must not, father,\\" Herbert said, rousing himself, \\"I am better, decidedly so. do not need anybody but mother. Go to bed, please.\\" As Mr Rans hesitated, he added: \\"You make me nervous.\\" Rans obeyed, but once again during the night he put his bald head inside the door and asked how Herbert was. \\"His fever is higher, think,\\" Mr. Rans replied, quiver in her voice, \\"and there is some blood. Rans said no more, but gently closed the door. Possibly two hours later, when the first faint gray of the morning was seen in the east, Mr. Rans heard steps on the stairs, and quietly opening the door was face to face with her husband and the doctor. Mr Rans had walked, or run, all the way to town after him. \\"You must hurry,\\" he had said to the physician, puffing and blowing as he spoke. \\"Herbert is very sick, and his mother is un easy. Herbert was seriously ill for several days, then he got back to his usual state of semiinvalidism again. As he rode up the drive he saw plainly Viola and her companion through the window, and involuntarily he started. \\"Mary Herbert\'s son,\\" he muttered, jerking the bridle till his horse reared, \\"the resemblance is striking, wonderful.\\" He entered the house through the side door, going softly up the stairs to his own rooms. \\"He has Mary\'s features,\\" he said, \\"and her smile.\\" His apartments opened on the veranda above, and he went out upon it and smoked his cigar. He would think of something else, not of Mary Herbert, not of his youth. \\"Margaret Vane is very interesting, attractive girl,\\" he told himself. \\"I shall have Viola invite her to visit us. And shall go to make those speeches down in Lauderdale, Tipton, Fayette, and Shelby. wish the people to know me. do not intend to retire to private life, and rust out with thinking.\\" There were steps on the porch below, he glanced downward, the .young man was leaving. \\"He has not the build of Rans,\\" he muttered, looking after the visitor, contemptuous sneer upon his face.  \\"You have very handsome place here, Mr Felton.\\" Margaret Vane was standing with the congressman on the front porch at Oakland. She was attempting to button refractory glove as she spoke, and seeing her difficulty, he bent down and fastened it for her. \\"To me it is attractive,\\" he answered, lifting flushed face from his task he did not remember to have performed like service before; \\"then the association is pleasant,\\" he broke off abruptly, \\"you will consider such things more as you grow older.\\" She followed him down the broad steps to the drag standing before the door. \\"Do not talk that way, you are not old, and do not feel so.\\" \\"I do not feel old,\\" he replied, brightening, \\"and this morning positively am young.\\" They both laughed. \\"Come on, Viola! What is the matter, Charley?\\" he called, the natural impatience to start asserting itself. His niece and Wes ton hurried out of the house and took the back seat. Then, with Margaret by his side, Mr Felton gathered up the reins, and they were off. Once on the turnpike he turned the horses heads away from town. \\"Were you ever at barbecue before?\\" he asked of his companion. \\"No,\\" she replied, \\"this is perfectly new experience; am expecting new sensation.\\" \\"It will come,\\" Weston spoke from the back seat, \\"when you try some of the delicious barbecued meat.\\" \\"No,\\" Margaret replied, promptly, \\"it will come when hear Mr Felton speak.\\" The congressman smiled down upon her. \\"You want to hear me, then?\\" \\"Indeed, do; that is the reason came,\\" she lowered her tones. \\"The rest is nothing to me.\\" It was beautiful morning, the air was cool, delicious; the forests were beginning to show yellow and crimson, and the sumac pushed its red head out from the sides of the road. Before they reached their destination the turnpike was full of vehicles of every description, some of them were wagons, the people in them sitting in chairs, moving their slow lengths along; some were stylish drags and buggies; there were rock-aways, too, and several family carriages. Representatives from the whole congressional district were expected to be present. The speaking began early and continued till dinner time. Then the long trenches were uncovered and the savory meat taken out. The odor that filled the air might have tempted the most delicate palate. \\"This meat is delicious,\\" Margaret said to Mr Felton. \\"I had no idea should so enjoy it.\\" \\"Of course it is good,\\" the congressman replied, \\"but there is much in the appetite we bring with us to these places.\\" He seated himself beside her on the root of forest tree. \\"It is well for people to go out in the woods sometimes,\\" he said, \\"to get away from conventions, not to have tables,\\" he pointed to what looked like half mile of tablecloth, and was bolt of goods stretched out upon the, \\"and take one\'s dinner from tin plate, that might reflect pretty face.\\" Margaret looked amused. \\"I had not thought of the advantage might derive from this,\\" she said turning the tin so that the sun fell dazzlingly upon it. \\"And drink,\\" he went on, \\"lemonade made in barrel, or strong cup of black coffee, or go down to the spring and find water as pure as crystal and cold as the heart of the hills.\\" He smiled, \\"and there is something stronger, to which the men claim the exclusive right.\\" \\"Let. us try the spring,\\" Margaret said, rising to her feet. They went through the crowd, Mr Felton stopping every few feet to shake the hand of an old friend or acquaintance. \\"Here are some fine peaches, Mr Felton,\\" young boy said, running up to him with basket of almost perfect fruit, \\"Mr Richard Bridges sent them.\\" \\"Where is Dick?\\" smiling into the face of the lad, \\"thank him, please, and say that want to see him after awhile. There he is now,\\" Bridges was motioning to him from little distance. \\"Deliver him the message, my little man. Bridges is the nominee for the legislature from Dare County,\\" explained to Margaret as the boy scampered away. \\"His father and were at college together, and are great friends.\\" \\"I know what it is to be member of politician\'s family for day,\\" Margaret said, examining her peach critically, \\"one receives so much attention.\\" \\"You could not stand it longer?\\" Mr Felton looked down quickly into her face. She flushed crimson. He laughed. \\"We old fellows grow very ambitious sometimes. Beware. \\"I thought you were not going to call your self old any more,\\" she protested, recovering from her embarrassment. \\"Uncle!\\" Viola and Herbert Rans came swiftly down the path to the spring to meet them. Mr Felton was handing glass of water to Margaret and did not give his niece very genial smile, and only nodded stiffly to her escort. \\"What is it?\\" he asked. Herbert spoke, \\"Weston has just told me, Mr Felton, that he will not return with your party this afternoon, and Miss Felton has consented to allow me to take her home in my trap that is if the arrangement is satisfactory to you.\\" The young man\'s face was flushed when he concluded, he knew that his was request that might be curtly refused. There was silence till the situation became awkward. Margaret drained the last drop from her glass, and Viola dug her parasol into the ground. \\"Yes,\\" the congressman said, finally, \\"you will, of course, leave when we do and arrive at Oakwood about the same time.\\" Viola and Herbert agreed to this and lost no time in moving away. \\"Your uncle gave me scant courtesy,\\" he said, \\"but am not sensitive so long as carry my point. He is more cordial now,\\" nodding his head to where Mr Felton was shaking hands with crowd of countrymen. He sang in low, sing-song voice: It fits my fist as no other can, The horny hand of the workingman.\\" Viola looked grave. \\"My uncle is very sincere,\\" she said, \\"of that am sure.\\" They strolled slowly along through the beautiful grounds, the trees making arches above their heads. The shadow that had been between them for some weeks had passed away. Their conversation was full of cheerful talk, of the latest jokes and gossip, and the personalities that are so pleasant to man and maiden when they are young. Mr Felton, with Margaret, drove rapidly homeward. All day the grays had been with out harness, under the shade of great tree, eating fodder, and they felt like going. With their heads turned side-wise they swept along, leaving all the vehicles and Viola and Herbert far behind. Mr Felton knew that the horses were gaining in speed every moment, but the road was straight and level, so he suffered them to have their will. Besides he was anxious to make the eleven miles to town before sundown, and they were late in starting. \\"There is fine hunting over there,\\" he said, pointing to an extended field of long grass they were passing. \\"Look at those birds, away yonder to the right. He spoke quickly, his trained eye following the swift flight. Just then they were startled by the loud, whir ring sound that all huntsmen love, and large covey of partridges rose in the field near them and flew toward the road. On the instant there came two quick, sharp reports of gun. It seemed fired at the heads of the horses. The grays swerved to the side of the road and bolted. Mr Felton tried to hold them, but without success, they were off on mad, terrified run. He kept them in the middle of the turnpike and felt sure of getting them under control in good time, but talk to them, saw the reins, pull as he would, their speed and terror seemed to increase. He thought neither the drag nor horses could long stand the furious pace at which they were going. Margaret had not spoken since the trouble began, brighter color had come to her cheeks and more intense glow into her eyes. As though fascinated, she watched the small heads of the frightened animals. The light vehicle swaying to one side and then the other, rushed onward over the road, now becoming rough and full of large un broken pieces of stone. The congressman\'s face was very stern. \\"I reckon have killed you,\\" he said, looking for an instant into the young girl\'s eyes, \\"there seems no possibility of these devils running themselves down.\\" He knew he must think rapidly; there was the bridge over Lynton\'s Creek, scarcely half mile away, something must be done before they reached there. He took the whip in his hand. \\"Brace yourself for another shock, Margaret,\\" he said, and brought it down with considerable force upon the flying horses. The grays unused to the lash, dashed forward. \\"Whoa, Rex! steady, Rogan! Steady, steady, boys!\\" For the first time they seemed to hear him, their stiff necks slightly bent to his strong pull, their pace almost imperceptibly slackened. The consciousness ran like an intoxicant through his veins. Surely they were slowing down, were becoming manageable. It was true, the grays recognizing their master\'s hand on the reins, came back to reason and allowed themselves to be brought to standstill. Mr Felton went to their heads; \\"Get out,\\" he called to Margaret, and nothing loath she obeyed, trembling from head to foot when she found herself on solid ground. \\"You are sure you are not killed,\\" he said, laughing as boy might. \\"Very sure,\\" she replied, \\"I was never more fully conscious of living.\\" She laughed, too, and stood near him while he examined the harness and patted the horses into hopeful state of docility. \\"Will you go on with me?\\" he asked at last. The young girl had little sense of personal fear, and there had come to her an exhilaration in the tremendous rush through the cool autumn air, with trees spinning past her as on railroad train. All the time he was regarding her with admiration, with genuine approbation. \\"Yes,\\" she replied, \\"I see no other way to get there, and then,\\" looking up into his face, \\"I am not afraid, can trust you.\\" The slight emphasis on the last word did not escape him. \\"You are wonderful girl,\\" he said, fervently. Without further trouble the grays, unabashed by their disgraceful conduct, their heads held aloft, pranced over the dangerous bridge and carried their charge safely to Oak land, whirling airily into the big gate, and drawing up with much style before the great front door. \\"You are very wonderful young woman, Margaret,\\" Mr Felton repeated, as he assisted her out of the drag. Then, suddenly be coming thoughtful, he followed her into the house. Herbert Rans and Viola came up the turn pike near Oakland. He was driving slowly. \\"I do not want to keep up with Rex and Rogan,\\" he had told her earlier. His father and mother passed them going in their family carriage from town. They all bowed, Mr. Rans, leaning forward, smiled pleasantly. Archibald Rans\'s face darkened. \\"I do not like that at all,\\" looking back at Viola and Herbert with scowl, \\"she is the only girl ever see him with.\\" \\"Oh, no,\\" his wife replied, \\"he goes about good deal.\\" \\"Always in the same direction; shall speak to him about this.\\" \\"Please do not,\\" she said, anxiously, \\"he has few pleasures, and we may not have him long.\\" \\"Why do you say that,\\" irritably, \\"he is getting better, is going to get well. And he has pleasure. Do not give him everything can no man is kinder to his son every thing is open to him. He spent more in one year at college than ever had in all my life till made it. Did say aught to him? No; but shall speak to him about this, and set it down pretty squarely, too.\\" \\"You have been generous, if generous be the word,\\" she replied, her voice was always low and sweet, \\"but do not make it burdensome obligation to him now. Have you not felt grateful to have Herbert to expend your wealth and love upon? What we possess would be of little value without him. Did you ever think there are some things even better than money?\\" Her tones were trifle reckless. \\"The fact that he is occasionally with someone whom you do not like, gives you no right to wound him. You will not do it when it comes to the test; Herbert, know, is first with you.\\" \\"Yes, he is more in my eyes than any one except he made an embarrassed pause, \\"except you, Mary; nobody could ever be before you with me. But there are some things will not stand even from him, he must let that girl alone neither she nor any of her people shall ever have dime of my money.\\" \\"I have no idea they want it; Herbert is attractive enough to be considered without his father\'s bank account. should be sorry if what you fear were true, but love him well enough to make any personal sacrifice for his happiness.\\" \\"You are so far different from me,\\" he replied, getting out of the carriage, which had drawn up before the front door, and waiting to assist her. \\"I have not told you of my entertainment,\\" Viola said to Herbert. She did not add that she had put off this communication till they were nearly home. \\"It is to be given in Miss Vane\'s honor, and uncle and have friend who will be with us. Come over and help Margaret and me we are making all sorts of impossible plans,\\" she spoke excitedly. He disregarded all but one portion of her communication \\"Who is your friend?\\" he asked. \\"Mr Phillip Carston.\\" \\"The congressman?\\" He was watching her closely, and she grew nervous under his gaze. \\"Yes, knew him in Washington. He is great favorite of my uncle.\\" \\"I have met him,\\" Herbert said; \\"he is considered coming man politically, and is set down with the matrimonially eligible, which, take it, is better than to be among the immortals.\\" \\"I do not understand you,\\" she replied, coldly; \\"he is a—\\" \\"All around good fellow, have no doubt,\\" interrupting her; \\"he was very kind to me in Washington. was there with cousin of his, we went over from college.\\" He spoke indifferently, as one might of man who had shown him courtesy, but Viola noted that all enthusiasm had gone from him, and that the blue veins stood out like cords upon his temples. There were many Chinese lanterns dropping from wires and draped from tree to tree upon the grounds of Oakland, and the drive to the house was marked by great lamps with very bright reflectors. These were ready to be lighted at moment\'s notice. All the town was coming to Viola\'s entertainment. For days she, Margaret, and Herbert Rans had been arranging everything according to their fancy. The infinitesimal had grown to colossal importance, the placing of vase, or the fall of drapery was subject for serious thought. In the house flowers were planned to be put in every available space. The parlors were set apart for chrysanthemums, the library for roses, and in the hall palms, century plants, and great tree fern were to stand. \\"The chrysanthemums are for uncle and Margaret,\\" Viola said, jestingly, to Herbert. \\"And the roses are for you and me,\\" he replied, pleased and happy at the association. Mr Felton looked on at the flutter of preparations with an amused smile. Viola had said to him that she wanted to entertain Margaret, and he had consented gladly. The day before the eventful evening he came to his niece with look of alarm upon his usually non-committal face: \\"Viola, child,\\" he said, \\"I am afraid that you are not providing sufficiently for these people. Men have excellent appetites. shall be mortified if there should be any he faltered for the proper word, \\"anything like lack of attention to this matter.\\" He looked over helplessly at Margaret. \\"Why, my mother used to spend days, and have her friends assist her, just in baking the cakes see nothing of that sort going on here.\\" \\"There is no cause for alarm, Mr Felton,\\" Margaret\'s eyes twinkled with merriment; \\"Viola has given the order, and stated the number of guests to good caterer, and he will see that your friends are abundantly satisfied. As to the old-time cake-baking, like Moliere\'s doctor, we have changed all that.\\" The congressman seemed much relieved. He took seat beside her, and drawing some of the cedar she was making into wreaths through his fingers, said: \\"You and Viola must go in and talk with Mr. Justice about the minutiae he glanced up half shyly, \\"we want everything in good he laughed \\"Is not \'style\' the word?\\"Viola,\\" Margaret called to the hostess in the next room, \\"we have been insulted again. Your respected uncle wants to turn this whole affair over to Cousin Alice.\\" There came no response, and she smiled at her companion. \\"If it is of any comfort to you, will say that the lady in question has had us well in hand from the beginning, and she and Cousin James are coming out to assist in receiving the guests.\\" \\"That is just as it should be. Of course, wish you and Viola always for ornament, for pleasure, but Mr. Justice has had more experience.\\" With his elbow on the back of the settee upon which they sat, he watched, looking over her shoulder, the graceful fingers flying in and out among, and holding and tying the ever greens. \\"How pretty your hands are,\\" he said, taking one of them in his own; \\"you will scratch, injure them at this rough work, do not like to see you doing it.\\" He turned over the palm, examining it pleasurably. \\"No, it is not scratched,\\" she said, \\"what you see is only the dust from the cedar.\\" She looked up into his face, questioningly. \\"What is it?\\" he asked. \\"I cannot make wreaths so long as you hold my hand,\\" she said, \\"and Viola and Herbert will be waiting for me.\\" \\"Well, let them wait,\\" lifting the finger tips to his lips, \\"let them make their own garlands and leave you to me. His niece\'s voice came to them from the next room. \\"Now, Mr Rans, tie that just there. If you are quick about it, can hold the cedar in place.\\" They were very near the door. Margaret went back to her work. Mr Felton\'s brow darkened. \\"You do not fancy Herbert?\\" she said in lowered tones. \\"I scarcely know the young man,\\" still looking over her shoulder and watching the now not very swift fingers, \\"his father and are enemies.\\" \\"They are very different; Herbert is like his mother, whose idol he is,\\" she gathered the evergreens up in her lap and crossed her hands upon them. \\"Why that lovely, refined woman could have married Mr Rans is mystery to me, but possibly it was for mercenary motives.\\" His eyes looked past her, through the window, over the wheat fields, to clump of forest trees where was once Mary Herbert\'s home. \\"I do not think she married him for his,\\" he said, very quietly. \\"Let me move this seat for you,\\" rising to his feet, \\"or rather let me get some of these ropes of cedar out of your way, or better still,\\" bending over her and speaking persuasively, \\"Come for walk. You have been sitting here long time, and have had very little of your society.\\" She donned her jacket and hat and went with him.  Judge and Mr. Justice, Miss Vane, Viola, and Phillip Carston were in the parlors promptly at eight o\'clock. The host came somewhat later, having the air of man who is trying to persuade himself that the occasion is one of pleasure. But Margaret had no thought of permitting him to be dull. She immediately went with him for look of the long, beautiful rooms. She insisted that he admire the decorations, and finding rosebud to her fancy, fastened it in his coat. Mr Felton\'s face cleared, such attentions were new and very pleasant to him. In the light of the soft-toned lamps Margaret Vane appeared very beautiful, and her eyes were hazel, not gray to remind him of his youth. He admired her more than ever to-night. The evening gown became her well; and she was graceful, attractive, and of charming personality, he thought with glow of pride that she would do her husband credit in any position to which he might attain. Some lines read long ago, had come into his mind before he left his room, they returned to him now: When all things change about us Why persist in trying to fix fast forever That which of all things is the, sentiment.\\" And the \\"Why not?\\" he had asked himself that evening with Mr. Blake in Washington, returned to him now. \\"I am an old fool,\\" he thought, and with start realized that he had lost his companion\'s last remark. \\"Sit here,\\" she repeated, \\"and tell me what you think of this marriage of Viola\'s.\\" \\"Have matters gone so far?\\" he asked, dully. \\"Yes, she and Mr Carston admitted as much to me this morning, believe you are to be interviewed upon the subject to-morrow.\\" \\"I think,\\" he said, answering her first question, \\"I shall be very lonely, Margaret; that need some one to take her place, to enter into my heart into my life.\\" He placed his hand gently upon her shoulder, and regarded her earnestly, questioningly. There had been the sound of tuning musical no instruments for some time, now the full strong strains swept through the rooms and in upon them. The entertainment had begun. There came the noise of arrival in the hall, the hum of pleasant voices in the parlors, and still the band played on, the notes growing stronger, sweeter than before. The waltz they played was woman\'s love, She stood and stroked her long, white glove.\\" \\"The guests are all here,\\" she ventured, \\"we must go back to our places.\\" He did not stir. \\"You have not answered my question,\\" speaking firmly. He was man who, when his mind was made up, recognized no cause for delay. He was called man of one idea and persistent. Some one had said of him that patiently finding the right and steadily keeping to it, had been the cause of his success in life. Good fortune had not come to him by brilliant leaps, not by bold dashes, it was the result of careful planning. Once blinded impulse, hate, recklessness had been his undoing, but only once. Gentle and tender-hearted at the bottom there were times when he was as inflexible as justice, as cold as steel, when no gentle emotion was permitted to find its way to his heart. No one doubted his honesty, or his courage and his closest friends and supporters knew that while he gave them perfect loyalty, the same must be rendered to him in return. This quality of his nature must have communicated itself to the young girl, for her answer was direct and unwavering. \\"No, but shall later.\\" They met Herbert Rans in the hall. The young man had an amused, significant smile upon his face that was lost on Mr Felton, but brought the crimson dye surging to Margaret\'s temples. \\"Where have you been?\\" he said, joining her while the congressman passed on before them to the receiving party. \\"Miss Felton has had me looking for you everywhere; we feared you had eloped with the brave and reverend senior.\\" The guests were coming in rapidly, crowding the staircase and front of the hall, their jests and laughter rising in waves of sound. Margaret was too much afraid that Herbert\'s remarks would be overheard to resent them. \\"Hush,\\" she said, peremptorily, \\"I am not so punctual as Viola. One wastes much time when one is. dare say,\\" making defensive rally, \\"the roses you sent her are withered ere this.\\"  \\"Not more so than the ones you carry.\\" His quick laugh did not decrease her discomfiture. \\"That music is divine,\\" leaving off teasing and speaking heartily; \\"I wish might waltz it out with you.\\" \\"I think you reminded me that my duty was here,\\" she answered. He did not fail to note the excitement and elation of her manner, \\"but, you may come for me later.\\" \\"Then do not forget,\\" giving place to some one, \\"I can only dance few times; promised mother to be careful.\\" Phillip Carston stood to one side watching the new faces about him. After the much introducing and the more conversation that he had gone through with, he was taking breathing time; and longed earnestly to get away somewhere to smoke cigar. \\"It was good in Viola to have all the town out while am here,\\" he commented, \\"but would have forgiven her had she neglected this delicate bit of attention.\\" He laughed inwardly, the situation was diverting to him. He had come hundreds of miles to see her, and only her, and here he was making himself generally agreeable and being frowned upon by this handsome young Rans. \\"Poor fellow, he is pretty hard hit. He did not think saw the scowl upon his face when Viola and were together half an hour ago, but did. Ah!\\" The selfgratulation was brought to an abrupt standstill. Viola was in the doorway glancing around as though anxious to see how the entertainment was passing off. She saw Carston seemingly happy and content, but Herbert was stationed back of the newel post, his shapely head almost lost in the decorations he had helped to arrange on the railing above. He looked gloomy, troubled, and evidently was making no effort to conceal the fact. Faces are masks, so it is said, but to some people it is comfort, necessity to let their thoughts, their dominant feeling shine out boldly, exultantly through them. \\"What is the matter?\\" Viola called to him, gayly. His whole countenance brightened. Nothing, crossing quickly to her, \\"only have not seen you for almost hundred years. They moved away together. \\"I have been here all the evening,\\" she answered, laughing. Let me find seat somewhere, not on the veranda, you were there with Carston, and tell me of yourself, of your friend, who has come like meteor, might say like thunder bolt, into our midst.\\" He spoke flippantly, but she had learned to know his moods too well not to see that he was terribly in earnest. \\"There is little to tell,\\" she replied carelessly, \\"a friend of my uncle, friend of my own is with us. \\"No, happy, successful lives have no his tory,\\" he pulled the flower from his coat and threw it away. \\"What have done now?\\" she asked in feigned dismay, \\"I fear you will be sorry you found me.\\" \\"I am cross and out of spirits, suppose,\\" he said. \\"What bore you must think me. \\"No, do not, but believe am better tempered than you are, Herbert.\\" He started and looked at her quickly; it was the first time she had called him by his Christian name. His spirits rose in an instant. \\"A great deal better in every way,\\" he said, heartily, \\"I sometimes think you haven\'t fault.\\"  \\"That is only sometimes,\\" she replied. Her pretty shoulders went up in very dis claiming shrug. \\"That sometimes is to-night, and always,\\" he declared, earnestly, so earnestly that Viola looked alarmed. But she gave him bright smile. \\"No, am only occasionally perfect, and then solely in the eyes of such dear friends as yourself,\\" she was moving away. \\"There, they are going Uncle Felton is beckoning to me. \\"How do you like Margaret Vane?\\" he asked, detaining her. Viola hesitated: \\"I like her,\\" she said, \\"Margaret is very brilliant, very attractive.\\" \\"Your young friend, Rans, is in love with you, Viola,\\" Carston said to her when all had gone. The words were not cheerful, and there was challenge in his voice. \\"I hope not think not,\\" she spoke earnestly. \\"He is dear, good fellow am fond of him.\\" \\"Humph!\\" \\"Not too fond,\\" laughing joyously, \\"I verily believe you could be jealous.\\" Then she bade him goodnight and went with Margaret Vane up the stairs. \\"The party was great success, Viola Margaret said, but neither of them was thinking of the entertainment. The next morning Carston spoke to Mr Felton. Weeks and even months passed rapidly enough the beautiful fall days lingered as benediction, the Indian summer, wistful and dreamy, swept spirit clouds across the sky. The grain ripened and fell golden and plenteous the partridges were heard like pipe-notes in the fields. There was not the languor, the exultation, the promise of the spring time, but rather the peace, the calm, the fulfillment of all things. And winter followed gradually, seeming to approach by parallel lines. Frost showed its face, crisp and white, in the early morning; chestnuts opened their rough burs invitingly, and the squirrels were all animation in the tree tops. Then the ground began to freeze, and once great snowflakes fell to dis appear with the sunlight. The people of the village had returned to quiet ways and winter habits. Congress was in session again and Mr Felton sat patiently in his seat in the House. \\"There is no use in your going on till after the holidays,\\" he had said to Viola. \\"I shall return at that time and take you back with me. Cousin Janie Barton has promised to stay with you while am away.\\" Viola assented, well pleased. Cousin Janie was the dearest, kindest old lady in the world, and besides she preferred not to go to Washington till the first of January. She desired to experience Southern Christmas, to be in her own home during one, to decorate with holly and mistletoe, and preside over the famous Christmas dinner. Great logs blazed at Oakland. Viola had never seen such pretty wood fires before, nor such pretty andirons, standing very tall, as sentinels or knights in armor, guarding the cavernous chimney-place, and reflecting the light, or making faces at the fire, or frowning down upon it in superior autocratic way when it smoldered or died. \\"Ye logs are for our pleasure,\\" they seemed to say. \\"Day after day great piles are brought from your forest to be consumed before us. But we remain unchanged. From our fixed station we have seen generations smile and suffer and pass; have watched tears, and known when high degree of happiness was felt in the old home stead. We have heard widowed mother\'s advice to her two boys, have known when poverty stretched its gaunt hand over the house, and when we were passing into the possession of aliens. And we have flashed swift, continuous joy since returning to our rightful master. If the ghost of fires long dead should come back they would say that we are sweeter tempered than we used to be. They might claim that it is the mellowness of age, but our strong hearts are untouched by time. We would tell them that it is the joy of once more reflecting the firelight of our own people, their children\'s children.\\" Many fantastic thoughts, as these, came into the young girl\'s mind as she sat alone before the great blazing logs. She imagined they would like to speak to her of the past. She saw pictures in the coals of youth and sweet-faced woman, who were, she knew, her father and her grandmother. Try as she would her own mother\'s face did not shine forth from the Felton\'s fire\'s heart. Once seemingly far in the past there appeared charming, girlish figure. It was almost too far away for recognition, and the boy beside it was not Viola\'s father. She glanced up at the portrait of two lads above the mantel, and the features she saw in the fire and those of the younger face were the same. The maiden now turned her head. Viola looked more closely, the picture was like Herbert Rans; she started forward, she was surely gazing upon his mother when girl. Viola\'s brain was very full of thought, of conjecture. She put her hand over her eyes, they were stiff and swollen from long gazing in the fire\'s depths. Aunt Dilsey\'s (one of the old Felton servants) words came to her, \\"In dem days, young Mistiss, Miss Mary Harbut was wid us lik one o\' de fambly. Then again, \\"No, Miss Vola, yo\' pa, Marse Jeff, warn marri\'d till ole Miss haid been dead putty nigh er year.\\" Viola had gathered together good deal of family history these past few weeks. The old servants were coming up to remind Mr Felton of their existence, and that they expected to receive their full share in the annual gift making. \\"My poo\' Phil aint got no work,\\" Aunt Dilsey said, \\"an he wife an\' chillen is dat poo\' cries erbout \'em constant. Tell Marse Felton \'bout dyah condition, youn\' Mistiss. He sho ter do some\'in\' er urrer. Tell \'im ole Dilsey say ter hope \'em.\\" In the absence of her uncle, Viola had to hear their requests, troubles, and reminiscences, too, of the old days \\"whin ole Miss was so good ter \'em dat dey never wan\' fur nothin\'.\\" So, from word here and there, she had gradually understood the situation and motive and had become en rapport with the condition of things about her. This afternoon she held book in her hand, but the pages possessed no interest for her. What is the use for other people\'s thoughts when our own are crowding, tripping over one another, each separately demanding the field. But now Herbert Rans secured the position of vantage. He was looking pale, she thought, and his eyes were sunken and gave forth an expression of settled discontent. Viola had not seen him recently, and wondered at the cause of his absence. If there were any twinges of conscience in regard to Herbert she was but dimly conscious of them. Her thoughts were not pleasant, how ever, so she left her seat and went into the hall. James was just receiving some one at the door, and that some one she saw with rush of pleasure, was the young man of her thought. \\"Where have you been?\\" she asked, when they were comfortably seated and had commented upon the weather. This seemingly necessary adjunct of conversation being gone through with, they were ready for something of interest. did not know what had become of you.\\" She was genuinely glad to see him and he brightened somewhat at her welcome. But he answered \\"Been ill, of course,\\" gloomily, \\"worse than usual this time.\\" \\"I was afraid as much and am sorry,\\" she spoke gently, she could see that what he said was true, his face was marked with lines of suffering. \\"I wish you were more careful, Herbert.\\" She called him Herbert now. \\"There is no use,\\" he replied, \\"I have tried for mother\'s sake,\\" his voice lowered, \\"and for yours but shall never be well, only drag on few more useless years of pain. And am so eager for the conflict,\\" starting up; \\"I have sometimes thought might get well he looked at her wistfully; \\"if the impossible would happen.\\" He gave hoarse laugh. \\"You are better now, do not worry,\\" she said, almost tenderly, \\"none of us have any thing but the present.\\" \\"Yes, you have hope.\\" His great cavernous eyes sought her own dumbly. She moved restlessly under his gaze. Why would he talk like this and make them both miserable. But she must do something to put him on better footing with life. \\"Christmas is almost here,\\" she said, changing the subject abruptly, \\"I begin to feel it in the air.\\" \\"What is it going to bring you?\\" eying her curiously. \\"A happy, pleasant season, trust to us both.\\" Somehow she felt very sorry for him this evening. \\"Not to me, you will be going away when it is over.\\" They were both silent, then she said \\"The session is short.\\" He did not reply, he felt in no mood for conversation, and in no spirit to help to make it. He was dissatisfied with himself, angry with Viola, and disgusted with the world. He thought he would like to hurt some one, to vent his fury somewhere, to crush, stamp out life, to be cruel, mean. Frail and delicate as he was he could have rushed at an antagonist with the fierceness of tiger. \\"I have had an experience this afternoon,\\" she said; \\"I believe all the ghosts of Oakland have shaped themselves in that fire,\\" pointing to it. \\"There have studied bits of family history, caught glimpses of vanished romance. And,\\" laughing lightly, \\"possibly following the line of heredity, was thinking of you after the fire vision passed. He neither smiled nor seemed amused at what she said. \\"Perhaps am to be another added to your ghostly company. All at once he threw back his head and spoke under excitement: \\"I was in town this morning and heard that you were expecting visitor for the Christ mas Why did you not tell me yourself?\\" Her face flushed. \\"I have not seen you for days, you remember.\\" \\"But you knew he was coming when we last met. Viola!\\" starting up suddenly and clutching her arm. \\"I am afraid you will marry him, and believe it will kill me.\\" He spoke fiercely, his wild, blood-shot eyes burning into her own. Viola was frightened. \\"Oh, Herbert, you hurt me, you distress me,\\" she cried. \\"What is it you are saying? Sit down and will tell you anything know.\\" He sank back into his seat. \\"Do not marry him, Viola! He is stern and cold he could never love you as do. Put aside your own ambition, your uncle\'s dislike for us, and be my wife. You do not love him.\\" He was very pale; his face he tried to hold firm, but the lips would tremble. He was young, just boy, younger than his years, and he was sick. \\"Hush, Herbert,\\" Viola said, \\"you must not, you shall not, talk so; it is madness. You are my friend, my dear friend; you should have had my confidence earlier, you shall have it now. \\"I am not your friend we are not friends,\\" he said, \\"you know it have known it all the time. And do not want your confidence. Give it to Margaret Vane, to Charley Weston, to whom you will, but not to me. will not have it.\\" He strode toward the door. \\"You are making me miserable,\\" she said, rising and taking step forward, \\"do not be angry with me, Herbert.\\" She threw her softest intonations into the words. \\"That matters little now, think,\\" he replied, \\"and shall not trouble you with what you are pleased to term our friendship any more something circumscribed to the limits of your uncle\'s prejudice. By all means please the old gentleman his nature is so genial, so tractable, so winning, it should be rewarded.\\" He laughed scornfully. He was standing in the door, and as he finished speaking, went out closing it behind him. Viola, from station by the window, watched him as he went slowly down the walk to the gate. He looked so thin, so frail there was heavy wind at the time, and his body seemed to sway in it like tender tree, or an exotic that should be shielded from the storm. She could see the profile very white and stern, the brown hair that waved back from the pallid brow, then turning suddenly away, she threw herself into chair, and she did not know why, but she wept. The holiday season brought Phillip Carston again to Oakland. What before was conjecture then became certainty, he would surely be married to Viola Felton. The gossips had it at their tongue\'s end, some thought it \\"lovely match,\\" others felt sorry for \\"poor Herbert Rans,\\" but they added, \\"Herbert\'s suit was out of the question from the beginning, her uncle would never have tolerated such thing, and Mr Felton is man not to be trifled with.\\" There were whispers, too, vague and indefinite, that the congressman himself was thinking of other matters than politics; that henceforth Washington and ambition would fail to charm him unless shared with Margaret Vane. And Margaret laughed and jested and was gayer, brighter, and handsomer than ever before. \\"I am uneasy about our friend, Mr. Blake,\\" Weston said, breezily, to Viola. \\"I was picking her for winner until this dark-eyed maiden entered the lists. I\'ve never known widow distanced before. My chief did not seem nearly so sentimentally disposed toward her this winter, though have never seen her more ravishingly fetching, and poetic, or seemingly better prepared to be very attentive listener.\\" At dinner he had communication to make to them, and went about it after his own fashion. In an animated way, giving his remark distinct importance, he said: \\"Miss Vane is in town again; had delightful chat with her on the street to-day. Charming girl!\\" Mr Felton\'s expression was an approval. \\"Yes, saw her, too,\\" looking up with interest from his soup, \\"and, Viola, told her you would claim part of her visit.\\" The Christmas came and went. Joyously the merry bells rang, as so many Christmas bells have rung, as so many Christmas bells will ring. This is the day that has gathered the most sunshine of all the days. It is the day that brings out the best feeling; that takes the world back to love, to friendship, to cheerfulness, to infinite toleration. It is filled with the fireworks, the presents, the raillery, the merry laugh, the egg-nog, the innocent mirth of childhood, the mellowed bonhomie of later years. Oh, the Christmases that have come and gone! Oh, the Christmases that will come and go! \\"Can Uncle Felton be in love with Margaret?\\" Viola asked of Carston in an awed whisper. \\"I never looked upon the matter seriously until yesterday morning when we were all so merry over the egg-nog.\\" Carston was too busy with his own affairs to give the matter much consideration. He was with Viola, the day was fine. They had thrown up the window and were standing in it the world seemed at peace with him and with itself. \\"I do not know,\\" he said, and then added with laugh, \\"My distinguished friend does seem rare prize for any woman to take in charge.\\" \\"Oh, yes,\\" she agreed, too serious herself to see that he spoke in jest. \\"Jake! Jake!\\" Mr Felton\'s voice came distinct and clear to them from the road, and negro urchin was seen flying through the trees to the gate, which swung open as by magic. \\"Here they are,\\" Viola said just as her uncle and Margaret Vane in high-top buggy, and driving splendid thorough-bred horses dashed into the lawn and around the drive to the house. Mr Felton\'s arm was in sling, caused by the falling of window in the railway coach coming home from Washington, and Margaret had driven him into town. She held the reins as one who had guided spirited horses all her life. \\"It would never happen,\\" Viola said, watching them, shadow on her face, \\"if were not going to be married.\\" \\"We will not give up our marriage on that account,\\" her companion replied, hotly. \\"We have had glorious drive.\\" Margaret was full of enthusiasm and animation, smiles rippled about her pretty mouth, and the exhilaration of rapid motion showed itself in the flashes from her eyes and the bright color in her full, beautifully rounded cheeks. She crossed the porch and came and stood by the window in front of Viola and Carston. \\"The new horses are splendid,\\" she continued, resting her parasol on the window frame. \\"Mr Felton,\\" glancing back at him, \\"I think never saw animals better matched in appearance, speed, and step.\\" \\"Come and take look at them,\\" Mr Fel ton called to Carston, \\"come all of you,\\" he added. And. the three trooped out to give their opinion of the new purchase. The happy proprietor pointed out to them all the strong points of the thoroughbreds, examining and commenting upon, with the appreciation of connoisseur, the splendid descendants of Electioneer. \\"And Miss Vane likes them, which fact pleases me very much,\\" he continued, looking up with genial smile that was meant for Margaret. \\"I did not wish to drive her behind the grays again.\\" Margaret\'s attitude in regard to Mr Felton\'s candidacy for the Senate was very gratifying to him. Possessing distinct taste for politics, she mastered his speeches and discussed them with great intelligence. She read all the compliments to him in the newspapers the state press was full of his praise and spoke of them at the most opportune moments. The incense she offered was subtle and charming to this man who had seen little of social life and no man, no matter how much he has mixed in it, ever gets beyond the fascination of appreciation. The personal element is always attractive, and why should it not be so? The impression that one receives may not be lasting, it may not be the strongest and best, but it is pleasant for the time. \\"Will you not go down to the state capital to-morrow, Mr Felton? Many of your friends went to-day,\\" Charley Weston stood on the hearth-rug, his legs very wide apart, facing the congressman. The new year had begun. new legislature had assembled at the state house, the new governor was to be sworn in, and new senator was about to be elected. Weston was fully alive to the importance of the occasion, and was reasonably confident of success, but on the eve of any crisis there is excitement. Then he had been confident before, and now did not trust implicitly in his own judgment, nor the judgment of his chief\'s closest friends. \\"I think not, Charley, yet if thought could be of service Weston interrupted him: \\"Of course you could do good. There is nothing like being on the ground. Your influence over men is wonderful, and you could show us where the wires should be pulled the hardest. We will win this time,\\" he went on, cheerfully. \\"The legislature is after my own heart.\\" Mr Felton was grave and thoughtful. \\"I am very doubtful about the result; no one can tell what any body of men will do.\\" He rose to his feet, shrewd, masterful expression coming suddenly into his face. \\"You know my friends, Charley,\\" resting his resolute eye upon the young man and gesturing with his forefinger, \\"those we can rely upon, see them and have them strike, my boy, to win. can not afford to be defeated. It would be my political death warrant.\\" He turned and looked out of the window for moment. The congressman was very restless after his secretary had gone. He could not compose himself to write, nothing suited him, his papers were all awry, his books piled up in the wrong places. He wondered why Viola did not come to arrange his desk, then remembered that she had gone to spend the day with Mr. Justice. \\"I did not think her mother\'s daughter could have so wound herself about my heart,\\" he said aloud. \\"I wish she would not be married, but like Carston. Pshaw!\\" He turned away, and wandered about the library hunting for things aimlessly, and could not find them. He thought of going for walk, but the day was gray and overcast, the air chill. He decided not to go to town there would be too many political questions discussed, and too many conjectures vouchsafed not to jar upon his overwrought sensibilities. \\"When get old, will be content to sit here and read?\\" he thought. The possibility caused him to start to his feet. No, would rather die in the harness. Yes,\\" meditatively, \\"I shall go to the state capital to-morrow.\\" Then without any apparent relevancy he repeated twice the name of Margaret Vane. He was still seated at his writing table, maybe looking backward, maybe following the uncertain workings of the legislature, maybe dwelling upon belated love dream. His study door opened. \\"Dyah\'s lady in de parlor \'sires ter see yo\', Marse Felton,\\" James, the butler, said. Mr Felton looked annoyed. \\"Very well, show her in,\\" without glancing at it. Mr Felton arose to his feet but there must be some mistake, something the matter with his eyes, with the light, for it could not be Mary Herbert, Mr. Rans, who stood before him. He passed his hand across his eyes to clear the vision, then, seeing that it was indeed she, he bowed profoundly. \\"Will you not have chair, madam?\\" he said quietly. She took the seat he wheeled for ward for her. \\"I know you are at loss to conjecture the purport of my visit,\\" she said, tremor of excitement in the low, sweet voice; \\"you must know, feel sure, the effort it has cost me.\\" Mr Felton made deprecatory gesture. \\"I beg to assure Mr. Rans that in any way possible shall be glad to serve her.\\" \\"I am not sure of that,\\" she replied, \\"yet have come to you to speak to the nobler, better instincts of your nature; not to the sordid, vindictive man you have become.\\" He started forward. \\"Strong words, madam, but you are exercising woman\'s prerogative. \\"Strong words, yes, and harder because they are true. have been forbearing to you and yours.\\" For the first time he threw back his head and looked at her long and earnestly; his eyes had not voluntarily sought her own since they were young together. He saw slight, even now beautiful woman, clad in gray the eyes were grayer than the dress, the hair was lighter than the eyes. You have seen gray day by the sea, when water, and sky, and everything are the same; when the wind refuses to roar, and the ocean strikes with muffled beat calm. So it seemed with this woman, her eyes were the grave, gray ocean stilled. \\"If thought so, should not be here now,\\" she said, \\"and came not to ask favor, but to demand right,\\" the calm of her nature was broken. \\"It has come to me like revelation, suddenly, painfully, that you would make the past stand between my son and happiness; that you would strike the mother through her child. thought too much of your old, fair-minded, independent spirit remained for that.\\" \\"I do not understand;\\" he said dimly, \\"but am not the man you used to know, Mary.\\" She started. \\"What have done to harm your son?\\" \\"You have robbed him of the best that is in life; you have stood between him and his love.\\" \\"I? have done none of this you cannot mean what you say. God knows, have never tried to do you aught but good.\\" \\"Have you not separated him from your niece? Are you not hurrying her into marriage with another?\\" She had risen to her feet, and stood looking down upon him. \\"No!\\" he replied, \\"there is some mistake, you are deceived. did not think you would credit me with being match-maker, Mary.\\" He laughed scornfully. \\"I did not know that your son was suitor for Viola\'s hand. have never advised her to marry Carston. know little of women, and most of that little is unpleasant, except Viola love her very much. It was trial at first to have her, now it is deprivation to let her go. did not think could feel so tenderly to Agnes\'s child.\\" Mr Felton\'s voice was gentler than it had ever been, even to Viola. \\"She knows of the silence between the families?\\" \\"Enmity is better word. Yes, think so, am sure she is ignorant of the cause.\\" \\"Herbert does not know of this visit; trust he may never know. He holds his life by thread, with care he may recover, but hopeless, dispirited, miserable, know he will die. Viola loves him she must love him, handsome, brilliant, attractive as he is. Then why is she making this sudden marriage, except that she knows you approve of this congressman and disapprove of Herbert? By all that was sweet and holy in the past en treat you to be generous, to be just; release her from all duty to yourself in the matter, and tell her to follow the dictates of her own heart. \\"And marry Rans?\\" \\"Yes, Herbert-Rans!\\" \\"If do,\\" he cried vehemently, \\"and if it be true that she loves your son, and has bound herself to this other. If the gentle flower that has come to me in life would turn from me to your husband\'s child, then my faith in humanity, in justice, in mercy is over.\\" \\"You will not forbid her marriage to Herbert, then?\\" The words came with difficulty, her hands were clinched till the nails cut through her gloves. would not have it otherwise if what you suppose be the case.\\" Mr. Rans\'s eyes filled with tears. \\"How the past comes back to me, seeing you,\\" he said. \\"It is difficult to feel myself in the present. How has it fared with you all these years?\\" \\"I have not risen to fame and prominence, as you have,\\" she replied, brushing away tear, \\"I knew it was in you. have watched your course and have been glad of your success. Good-by.\\" She extended her hand, he caught it in both of his own. \\"I have your promise,\\" she whispered, \\"forgive my coming,\\" and was gone. Mr Felton sank back into his seat, and covered his face with his hands; great drops of moisture stood upon his\\" brow. The man came in to replenish the fire and light the lamps, it was growing late. \\"Has Miss Felton returned?\\" he asked. His own voice sounded strange to him. James replied that she had been at home for an hour. \\"Say should like to speak with her.  \\"You sent for me, uncle?\\" bending over him, \\"but was coming anyway. How are you? How have you spent the day without me?\\" \\"I have missed you,\\" he said, smiling back at her. Then, \\"I have sent for you, Viola; sit down, want to talk with you.\\" \\"I am ready,\\" she said, taking the chair that Mr. Rans had so recently occupied. \\"You look as if you were going to lecture, to scold me. You have never tried it before and are awkward in beginning.\\" She patted his arm affectionately, as sort of emphasis to her words. \\"Viola,\\" abruptly, \\"have you been honest with me? Are you sincerely attached to the man whom you have promised to marry, or have you been influenced by ambition or by what you fancied were my wishes in the mat ter? And in this have you done violence to other feelings, other sentiments of your heart?\\" Viola\'s eyes had opened wider as he spoke, the pupils were dilated till they were almost black. She had great desire to run away she had never seen him so difficult; she was little frightened. Viola\'s face clouded. \\"I like him,\\" she said, \\"very, very much.\\" Mr Felton sprang to his feet, walked the full length of the room, then came back and sat down. The fire blazed up suddenly, log had broken and fallen between the great andirons. Viola saw this, and involuntarily remembered what she termed her experience in the same place weeks before. Her uncle\'s voice recalled her to the present \\"Child, you know our families have not been friends, there has been settled feud between us for years. Archibald Rans has inflicted upon me the keenest wounds of my life, and in way that could not resent them. have seen this young man with you, there is something pleasing about him. They tell me he is brilliant and attractive. Do you know he is your cousin, Viola?\\" \\"I know there is some connection,\\" she replied. \\"Yes, his mother is your mother\'s cousin. \\"That would make discord if ever thought of him, but never do.\\" Mr Felton was holding himself under great restraint, and asking questions after the manner of lawyer examining witness. \\"To go back to the son, you say you like him. My daughter, has this enmity influenced your marriage? Do you love young Rans, and are you going to marry Phillip Carston?\\" \\"Uncle!\\" \\"I suppose it is never too late to repair mistake this side of the altar. am poor hand to advise about marriage, but know about honor.\\" He breathed hard for moment. \\"I would not, however, have this old quarrel interfere with your future. My child, leave me and my wishes entirely out of the question, look into your own heart and decide. If you love this young man, and think that way lieth happiness, hope no fancied duty to me will deter you. do not like the Rans blood, but desire your welfare. \\"Uncle, why do you talk so? Why do you think so? There is some mistake; do not love Herbert. am fond of him as friend, cousin; have told him as much. But love Phillip; he has won my heart, and am glad that our marriage meets with your approbation. loved him before came to Tennessee, before ever knew Herbert Rans. Set your mind at rest, all is bright and beautiful in my life. She stood by his side as she spoke, and one arm stole about his neck. \\"Are you sure, child?\\" \\"Very sure,\\" she replied. \\"I am glad,\\" he said, then, after pause, \\"I suppose am glad.\\" He was thinking of Mary Rans. When Viola had gone, he drew himself up to his table, and wrote: \\"I have kept my promise. The case is not as you thought. For the sake of you had almost wished it; but it is better, believe me, much better. My will has not controlled the matter. look to the past for your belief in the entire veracity of this statement.\\" That was all. He folded and sealed the letter, then ringing the bell, sent it away. The letter to Mr. Rans dispatched, Mr Felton was soon lost in reverie. Much of his early life came back to him. It appeared to night in floods of light sometimes, in checkered phases at others. She could say the gentle word that would calm his tingling nerves, and rest his restless spirit. He heard again that soft voice of hers; no music had ever been so sweet to him; no sound had ever given him so much strength and courage for the battle of life. He would dwell on it all now, beautiful in the spring time she was. There were lovely pictures of her in his mind. And he saw Agnes stealing away Jeff\'s heart, and sowing discord and making mischief; he thought, too, of Rans, his treachery, his money his success. Then, there was chaos, his own bitter words the fierce quarrel with Mary, and all was over, and he went away. He came back, but it was too late. He dashed his hand down on the desk, knocking off vase of Viola\'s flowers. There was tap upon the door, and James came in bringing several telegrams. He saw there was news of importance and tore the first one open. It read \\"You have just been nominated for senator by the caucus. thousand congratulations. Will be formally elected in the morning. He knew this was great triumph, great victory; but he was dreaming to-night. He saw as though it were panorama before him, his whole future; he would go back to Washing ton, to the old arena of action and thought; and enter higher body of usefulness. Viola and Carston would be there, and he might be with them. He thought of Mr. Blake and Major Hillyer, but most of Margaret Vane. He would have excitement, success, the friction and combat of minds. The bills, the measures; the machinery of government piled up before him. His life would be full, his ambition satisfied. Yet he felt to night to have won and held the love of Mary Herbert; to have walked with her through all the years, would have been more blessed far, than the wearied honors of fame. And he knew that he desired to lay down all that life had given him for the picture of peace and contentment that hung in the past. But there was music without, they were calling his name; crowd was filling the lawn and gathering on the porch. All the town was coming to do him honor. Viola and Margaret Vane rushed in and Mr. Justice. They carried him into town; they lighted bonfires, and sent up rockets, and amid it all there came to him: \\"I have watched your course, and have been glad of your success.\\" The morning paper contained great head lines in honor of the successful candidate, applauding his past political career, and emphasizing his ability, character, and eminent fitness for the position. The journal vouchsafed all sorts of conjectures as to what he probably would and would not do, and concluded by congratulating its especial division of the state, and its own town, upon being the home of the new senator. It contained also fairly good portrait of Mr Felton and brief sketch of his life. The wide, front doors of Oakland were thrown open, and the sunlight streaming through the casement made royal winter visitant. Many servants moved about the house in brisk, wide-awake way. Something evidently had happened that was pleasant. Telegrams were coming from all over the country; the messenger boys had ceased to ring the bell, but went on to the library to deliver them in person. \\"I am fond of this newspaper,\\" the young girl said, taking the double sheets and folding them carefully. Her uncle laughed. \\"It is an excellent journal and well edited,\\" he replied, \\"but never heard you so enthusiastic before.\\" The door opened. \\"Why Judge!\\" he exclaimed, \\"come in! How d\'ye do; when did you get home?\\" Mr Felton was by his friend\'s side and they were shaking hands enthusiastically. \\"By the morning train.\\" Judge Justice had triumphant air about him, befitting one who has scored victory and knows it. \\"There was no use in my staying longer, but Steele and Carter and Weston will remain till the legislature ratifies the nomination; wild horses could not pull them away before then.\\" They laughed together from pure excess of spirits. \\"You all are drunk full of greatness out here, see,\\" the judge continued, picking up the telegrams that covered the table, and reading one after the other. heard sad piece of news just now,\\" he said, taking off his glasses and turning to Mr Felton. \\"As was driving into your gate Dr. Strong came along. He tells me that Herbert Rans will not live through the day.\\" \\"Impossible!\\" \\"I expect it is true. The poor boy was out at your ovation last night, as well as he ever is. On the way home he was caught in that drenching rain and think the doctor said he ran to get out of it.\\" \\"Poor Herbert!\\" Viola exclaimed, \\"and he has never had anything he wanted in life.\\" Her voice broke and she went hurriedly from the room. The judge and Mr Felton discussed the caucus, the latter hearing how it was done and who did it! But all elation and enthusiasm had gone from him. The consciousness that gentle, self-repressed woman was watching the passage of life that was her life stilled him, held his faculties dormant; he caught himself listening to the words of farewell, straining his ears to hear the low, musical tones that would go with the well beloved up to the eternal gates. \\"Justice,\\" he said, clearing his throat in that peculiar way of his when in moments of perplexity or embarrassment, \\"has Margaret told you that several days ago she promised to become the wife of the new senator?\\" IN THE FACE OF THE QUARANTINE IN THE FACE OF THE QUARANTINE The morning train stood ready to move on schedule time not that the regular stops were to be made, for most of the stations between the city and the Tennessee River, nearly day\'s travel, were quarantined against every thing coming from the South. But Captain Ryan said in his business-like way, accepting the situation in the same breath: \\"We start on the minute, and will put off and take on passengers when they will let us.\\" Marcus Finley walked hurriedly along the main street, his hat pulled over his eyes; his step was quick and, if possible to one of his strength and vigor, nervous change from his masterful stride, due to days of unrest. The sun\'s rays were not fierce as they would be at noon, the sky was cloudless, luminously blue, and an indefinable yellow haze was every where. He met no one, and his footfalls rang on the pavement as horse\'s hoofs do on silent street at night. \\"I can\'t stand this any longer,\\" he ex claimed, dominated by sudden depression; \\"yellow fever or no yellow fever, duty or no duty, must get out of this town. He shook himself as chained Samson might have done. He reached the rooms of the Relief Association, and turned into them to speak with the secretary. \\"I\'m going away, Wingate, he said, leaning over the desk and shaking the man\'s out stretched hand, \\"and when I\'ve braced up some, filled my lungs with pure air, and my mind with something beside sickness, may come back.\\" He stopped in sense embarrassed, and ran his eyes over the list of new cases, and the calls for assistance that were spread out for inspection. \\"I don\'t like to desert you, old man, but I\'m no good with the fever patients, and am overwhelmed with this gloom; we are groping through the impenetrable at noon-day.\\" He laid down check, and turned away. But there was no time for futile fear; the room was filling with people clamoring for nurses, rations, clothing, and stimulants yes, for stimulants always, to steady the nerves, to raise the spirits, to prevent the inward sinking caused by seeing the havoc of the epidemic. Finley found it hard to get away from town at the door of the relief rooms he almost ran into the arms of the president of the board of health, the manager of the campaign against the pestilence, the man whose name was on every tongue, and whose daily telegrams were read with the same anxiety as are those of general sent during the progress of battle. The veteran looked gray, worn, but courageous; he seemed to experience stern joy in the fight he was waging. Was he not standing guard over the people! \\"Yes, Stanton is down,\\" he said, in answer to Finley\'s inquiry; \\"we were together last night attending very sick patient, and before daylight this morning was called to his bed side. cannot tell,\\" moving the handle of his whip slowly about the toe of his shoe, \\"how seriously his case may develop. Of course, hope for the best, but in this struggle with the epidemic he has shown reckless disregard of self.\\" \\"I fear so, at least there is large increase of new cases. \\"The business of the town is answering the cry of humanity,\\" Finley thought, as he went on his way; \\"if this spirit of good-will ex tended over the world it would usher in the millennium. He reached his rooms, hastily threw few articles of clothing into his valise, and re turned to the street. car drawn by one mule was passing out of sight. \\"I\'m sure of my legs anyway,\\" he thought, and started in brisk walk to the station. Marcus Finley was of magnificent proportions. Fully six feet in height, he stood as erect as an Indian, and carried his two hundred pounds as an athlete does his trained down weight. His features were strong, rugged, his eyes blue, his voice pleasant, his manner that of good comrade. His hair was red, and bristled an inch above his fore head. His spirits were rising. \\"I have carried many one away,\\" Ryan assented, shaking his head, and gazing thoughtfully out of the window, \\"and I\'ve got the Rev. Dr. Davis aboard this morning.\\" With his ticket punch he indicated man and woman the former evidently an invalid at the other end of the coach. \\"The little preacher looks like he has had pretty hard tussle with Yellow Jack.\\" Ryan moved on, examining tickets as he went. His going gave Finley an unobstructed view of the sick man, and he replied, speaking more to himself than to the conductor: \\"True, but the doctor has brought the enemy\'s colors away with him, he is abundantly in yellow. Then he smiled, for the forlorn countenance denied the assertion that, Nature rarer uses yellow than another hue. Saves she all of that for sunsets Prodigal of blue.\'\' The short train ran rapidly over the low monotonous country. Clouds of dust filled the car, sunlight streamed through every possible opening, and the glare burned and blinded the eyes, the heat was intense. Finley tied handkerchief about his neck, and smiled stoic ally at the discomfort. \\"This is sorry travel for an invalid,\\" he decided, \\"but when people are dying by hundreds day in place, one should not quarrel with the \'animal\' that carries him away from it. The yellow fever of the \'7o\'s will long be memorable.\\" He examined critically the faces about him with the hope of finding cheerful traveling companion. \\"I\'m the only able-bodied man of the lot,\\" he decided, stretching out his strong legs, and crossing his arms over broad chest; \\"the rest seem overwhelmed with ill health or low spirits. But that preacher down there is trump. He endured more, spent himself more in the cause of the sick in this epidemic than ten strong men ought to have done.\\" He passed his hand over his face, and through his hair, filling his eyes with the dust that had lodged in his lashes and brows. Finley recalled night not many weeks before, when he had watched beside friend, sick unto death with yellow fever. He could almost hear again the rustle of the draperies about the windows as they held, or threw back the summer wind. And in the dark, just before the breaking of day, the curtains parted, and the little preacher entered the room. Little bit of fellow, not bigger than minute, and not stronger physically than child I\'m mighty glad he\'s getting well.\\" In sudden concern, he glanced down the car, the train was jerking and swinging in way to put the nerves of an invalid to the rack. \\"This travel tells on man unless he is made of iron,\\" he remarked to the occupant of the seat in front of him; \\"I don\'t see how these convalescents stand it.\\" The dust was thicker, heavier, it got into the throats and nostrils of the luckless passengers, well-nigh stifling them, covered their clothes, and sifted in next the skin, causing great discomfort. The man Finley addressed turned around, his manner showing the relief it gave him to express his exasperation. \\"They have to stand it,\\" he said, gritting his teeth, \\"and they have to drink that muddy water brought in from the tanks. Ryan tried to stop back yonder,\\" indicating with his thumb the station just passed, \\"to put off passenger, and get ice, but he couldn\'t do it, the confounded place has joined all the rest against us.\\" \\"This quarantine is deadener,\\" Finley replied, his face and hair ablaze with indignation, \\"it would keep poor wretches cooped up in that plague-stricken town till they die, for only people with money can get far away. He was too fair-minded to stop there, and after moment\'s hesitation, added: \\"It is the policy of the surgeon who takes off the limb to save the patient, but he plays the deuce with the limb.\\" He leaned forward, and with vindictive energy threw his cigar out of the window. Neither Finley, nor any man on that, car had accepted the fact that an epidemic is public menace; they had only the point of view of the refugee. The cigar Finley flung away struck quarantine guard in the face, and at the same moment his companion thrust his head through the open window and shouted, \\"We don\'t want to stop in your old town!\\" For answer the top of the coach was covered with bird-shot that rattled as hail. The truth is,\\" leaning over the seat, and speaking earnestly, \\"the preacher is mighty sick, and we must get him off the car, if possible.\\" The train rumbled on the heat was as in tense, the dust as disagreeable, but all dis comfort was forgotten in the excitement of facing the quarantine. The whistle blew, the engineer only heralded the coming short distance away; every man on the train except Dr. Davis, bounded to his feet, and stood expecting an experience. hoarse, deep noise went up from the station it became louder, stronger, and an infuriated crowd surged about the entrance to the car guns were discharged in the air, and many voices were lifted in fierce altercation. The imprisoned passengers attempted to get for ward to see what force or argument might do, but the employees of the road blocked the way. Almost imperceptibly the coach began to move. All Finley\'s Irish blood was on fire. \\"Half dozen brave men could have used up the whole concern,\\" he said. The pinched face troubled him it was plain that Dr. Davis was unconscious. \\"He cannot last long. Mr. Davis\'s voice trembled as she spoke. \\"Would it be possible to put us off in the woods, we might find cabin near by.\\" The look in her blue eyes was desperate. \\"We will do better than that, madam,\\" he said, raising one foot, and stamping it on the floor either to give emphasis to his words, or to assure himself of the strength of his limbs. His impatience took him to the door where the conductor, considerably crestfallen, talked with the brakeman, his eyes fixed on the country flying beneath his feet. \\"It was not your fault, Captain,\\" Finley said, slapping the conductor upon the shoulder, \\"but we\'ll get ahead of these fellows next time. Stop at Crocket, if you can, slow up anyway,\\" he added, \\"and leave the rest to me.\\" \\"It is no use Ryan began. Finley interrupted him. \\"We can at least make the effort,\\" he asserted. They were passing stretch of beautiful pastureland through which ran cooling stream. Another, and still another station was called. Finley noted carefully the position and strength of the guards lined up about them to enforce the law. \\"Pretty fair guns, they have,\\" he thought, \\"and determined way of holding them, too, as if they meant business,\\" and he shrugged his shoulders. \\"The next stop is Crocket,\\" the brakeman announced, walking through the car, and making an elaborate show of unconsciousness. Finley rose to his feet, hurried down the passageway of the coach, and raised the little preacher in his arms. \\"Follow just behind me,\\" he said to Mr. Davis, and went forward with his burden, taking long strides, through the car and out on the platform. The train \\"slowed up\\"; Finley did not wait for it to come to standstill, but leaped to the board-covered space in front of the station, and stood within range of fifty shotguns. \\"He is sick, weary, and has not where to lay his head. The tumult these words created was so great that the anxious watchers on the train trembled. \\"Shoot me if you will!\\" Finley cried, catching the general excitement, his voice ringing clear above the noise, \\"but remember that no brave man, nor set of men, storms down the defenseless and the disabled.\\" \\"Put them back on the car, boys,\\" gruff voice shouted. He continued as though there had been no interruption \\"Dr. Davis is small specimen of humanity,\\" the sick man\'s long, thin hair fluttered in the wind, and his limbs hung limp from Finley\'s arms, \\"but his work is worthy of giant. You know of his service among the sufferers in the epidemic,\\" he paused for one brief second; \\"and now he has succumbed to that which he helped many to bear. It seemed as though they would tear the intruders to pieces. For the first time Finley looked full into the faces before him. \\"I recognize some of you,\\" he said, gravely, \\"and know your stout hearts; why, we\'ve faced death on the battlefield many times together. You answered the bugle call then, not man of you wavered when we stormed the breastworks. And now have you come to do battle against this little windmill of contagion! Ah, you were made for braver deeds than this, barring your doors against one who has fallen at his post! It was somebody\'s duty to look after those fever-scorched people, and it is somebody\'s duty to see that this man is taken care of now.\\" There was an impulsive swaying backward of the crowd, and stillness appeared in the faces at first so belligerent. It was midday; the sun beat mercilessly upon Finley\'s uncovered head; the bleached, shrunken boards of the station platform stared up into his face, half-blinding him; not breath of wind was stirring. \\"What are you going to do with this man?\\" he asked, solemnly.
