var fish = '[{"title":"The Big Fisherman","author":"Lloyd C. Douglas","since":"1948","bookcontent":"It was a calm, early summer noon in the southern mountains of Arabia. Sheltering the King\'s well-guarded domain, a mile above and a dozen miles east of the Dead Sea, motionless masses of neighbourly white clouds hung suspended from a remote blue ceiling. There had been an unusually heavy snowfall in the winter, not only upon the King\'s land but throughout the country. It was going to be a prosperous season for everybody. Intertribal jangling and discontent would be reduced to a minimum. Arabia anticipated a relatively peaceful summer. Viewed from the main entrance to the King\'s encampment the undulating plateau was a rich pasture on which a thousand newly shorn sheep, indifferent to the rough nuzzling of their hungry lambs, grazed greedily as if some instinct warned that there might be a famine next season. Nor was a famine improbable, for the distribution of snow was unpredictable. Almost never were two consecutive winters partial to the same area. This accounted for the nomadic habits of the people. They held no permanent property, built no permanent homes. They lived in tents; and, with their flocks, followed the snow and the grass. All but the King, whose encampment was a fixed establishment. When the King had a dry season the tribes replenished his purse. And few ever complained about this assessment, for the crown in Arabia was more than an ornament worn on state occasions. The King was indispensable in this country. He earned his wages and his honours. It required a strong and courageous man to deal equitably with these restless, reckless, competitive tribesmen who were distinguished throughout the East for the brevity of their tempers and the dexterity of their knives. It had been a long time since Arabia had been governed by a ruler with the moral and physical strength of King Aretas. Everyone respected his relentless administration of justice to the rich and poor alike. There was no favouritism. They all admired his firmness, feared his frown, and—for the most part—obeyed his decrees. Of course it would have been foolish to say that the Arabian people were sentimentally devoted to Aretas. In his difficult position he could not bid for their affection: he wanted only their obedience—prompt obedience and plenty of it. But there were a few who did sincerely love the taciturn, sober-faced, cold-blooded Aretas. First of all there was his motherless daughter Arnon, upon whom he bestowed a tenderness that would have amazed the predatory sheiks who had often been stilled to sullen silence under his hot chastisements. And there was battle-scarred old Kedar, who had taught him to ride when he was a mere lad of ten, who had watched him draw a man\'s bow to full tension when he was in his early teens, and had followed him worshipfully into all his hazardous adventures as Prince and King. And there were his twelve Councillors who, in varying degrees, shared his confidence. Especially there was Ilderan, Chief of the King\'s Council. And young Zendi, Ilderan\'s eldest son who, everyone surmised, would presently marry the Princess Arnon, with whom he was reputed to be much in love. Surely the wedding would be soon, they thought, for the Princess had recently celebrated her sixteenth birthday. The tribesmen, who rarely agreed about anything, were unanimous in their approval of this alliance. Not only was Arnon popular for her beauty and Zendi for his almost foolhardy courage, but—taking a long view of their marriage—there might come a day when Zendi would be their ruler; for if an Arabian king was without male issue the throne passed to the house of the Chief Councillor. Ilderan was nearing sixty. If anything were to happen to Aretas, which was not inconceivable, considering how dangerously he lived, the gallant young Zendi might succeed him. This would be generally acceptable. All Arabia looked forward to the royal wedding. It would be a great occasion. It would last for a week. There would be games, races and feasting. In the shade of a clump of willows sheltering a walled spring, not far from the royal encampment, Arnon was awaiting the return of her father, who had ridden early to the camp of Ilderan, seven miles east. She had joined him at breakfast, shortly after dawn, finding him moody and silent. \'Is anything amiss, my father?\' Arnon had ventured to ask. The King\'s reply was long delayed. Slowly lifting his eyes he had stared preoccupiedly at the tent-wall beyond her. \'Nothing you would know about,\' he had said, as from a distance. Arnon had not pressed her query. Her father had made short work of his breakfast. At the tent-door he had turned to say, \'I am consulting with Ilderan. I shall return by midday.\' For a long time Arnon had sat alone, wondering what had happened. Perhaps it had something to do with the message her father had received yesterday. Of course there was nothing strange about the arrival of a courier with a message. It happened nearly every day. But this courier—she had seen him riding away—was apparently from afar. He was attended by half a dozen servants with a well-laden pack-train. The donkeys had seemed cruelly overburdened. After the courier had departed, the King had retired to his own quarters. It was quite obvious that he did not want to be disturbed. Arnon strolled restlessly about under the willows, her thoughts busily at work on the riddle. Presently her wide-set black eyes lighted as she saw her father coming up the well-worn trail, at full gallop, on his white stallion. She knew what to do. Emerging from the shade, Arnon stood beside the bridle-path with her shapely arms held high. Aretas leaned far to the left—the stallion suddenly slackening speed—and sweeping his arm about the girl\'s slim waist, swung her lightly over the horse\'s shoulder and into the saddle. Arnon laughed softly and pressed her cheek against her father\'s short, greying beard. No words were exchanged for a little while. \'You have something very serious on your mind, haven\'t you, father?\' murmured Arnon. He drew the stallion down to an easy canter. \'I have had a strange message from Herod, the King of the Jews,\' said Aretas, slowing the impatient horse to a walk. \'Herod wants me to meet him for a private conference a fortnight hence, in the city of Petra.\' \'How fine for you, father!\' exclaimed Arnon. \'You\'ve always said you were going to visit that beautiful city!\' Quickly noting her father\'s lack of enthusiasm, she inquired, \'But—you\'re going, aren\'t you?\' \'Yes; it sounds important.\' \'Is it not a long journey from Jerusalem to Petra? I wonder why the Jewish King wishes the conference held there?\' \'Perhaps it is something that concerns Petra, too.\' There was an interval of silence before Arnon spoke again. \'Is this not the first message you have ever had from the King of the Jews?\' \'It is indeed! The first that has crossed our border for...\' Aretas paused to reflect. \'A hundred years?\' guessed Arnon. \'A thousand years!\' said Aretas. \'Many, many more than a thousand!\' \'What do you make of it, father? What does the Jewish King want of us?\' Aretas shook his head. They were arriving at the encampment now. Guards stepped out to meet them. Arnon was released from her father\'s arms and slipped lightly to the ground. Dismounting, the King beckoned to old Kedar, as his horse was led away. \'You will fit out an expedition to Petra. We are leaving on the third day of the week. The Councillors will accompany us, and a guard of twenty riders. We may be tented at Petra for one day—or ten: it is not yet determined. The Councillors will have had their instructions from Ilderan. You will attend to all the other arrangements.\' \'The festival tents?\' inquired Kedar, implying that his sharp old eyes had observed the royal insignia on the accoutrements of yesterday\'s courier. \'No,\' replied Aretas. \'We will take only the equipment we commonly use when we visit the tribesmen.\' Kedar bowed his grey head, his seamed face showing disappointment. He wanted to say that if the event was of high importance the King should make a better show of his royalty. He was turning away when Aretas spoke again, quite brusquely: \'And, Kedar, though you may have conjectured about the nature of our errand in Petra, if anyone should ask you what is afoot you will reply that you do not know. And that will be the truth.\' Retiring to his private quarters, the King resumed his contemplation of the conundrum. What ma02er of emergency could have induced the proud and pompous Herod to ignore the age-old enmity between their nations? For fifteen centuries, notwithstanding they were neighbours according to the map—their frontiers facing across an erratic little river that a boy could wade in mid-summer—the Arabs and the Jews had been implacable foes. This ancient feud had not been rooted in racial incompatibility, though there was plenty of that too. The antipathy had derived from a definite incident that had occurred long ago: so very long ago that nobody knew how much of the story might be mythical. But—let the tale be half fact, half fiction—it accounted for the bitter hatred of these people. According to the saga chanted about the Arabian camp-fires by wandering minstrels, a wise and wealthy migrant had ventured from Chaldea to the Plains of Mamre. It was a long story, but the minstrels never omitted their elaborate tribute to Chaldea as a land of seers and sages, oracles and astrologers. In Chaldea men dreamed prophetically and were entrusted with celestial secrets. Abraham, distinguished above them all for his learning, had received divine instructions to make a far journey southward and found a new nation. But the prophecy was in danger of lacking fulfilment, for the years were passing and the founder of the new nation was childless. Sarah, his ageing wife, was barren. To solve this problem, the perplexed idealist had won the consent of his wife to permit his alliance with a beautiful young native in their employ. A son was born to them. They named him Ishmael. He was a handsome, headstrong, adventurous child, passionately devoted to his desert-born mother, whom he closely resembled. Sarah, naturally enough, did not like him. Abraham admired the boy\'s vitality and courage, but Ishmael was quite a handful for the old man, whose hours of pious meditation were becoming increasingly brief and confused. To further complicate this domestic dilemma, Sarah surprised everybody by producing a son of her own. They named him Isaac. He was not a rugged child. His eyesight was defective; so defective that in his later life he had gone stone-blind. He was no match for his athletic half-brother. For a little while they all tried to be polite and conciliatory, but the inevitable conflict presently flared to alarming dimensions. Sarah no longer made any effort to control her bitter hatred for young Hagar and her tempestuous son. \'These impostors,\' she shouted, shrilly, \'must go! Today! Now!\' With appropriate misgivings Abraham conducted Hagar and their indignant boy to the rim of his claim, gave the bewildered girl a loaf of bread and a jug of water, and pointed south toward the mountains. Not a word was spoken. Abraham turned and plodded slowly toward his little colony of tents. Hagar did not look back. When the vagabond minstrels sang the old story, which, as the ages passed, lost nothing of the magical in the telling, they declared that Ishmael grew to full manhood that day. This may have been a slight exaggeration, though enough had happened to hasten his maturity. He swore to his mother that from now and henceforth for ever he and his seed would be at enmity with everyone else descended from his father\'s house. Seeking refuge among the savage tribes of itinerant shepherds and camel-breeders in the southern mountains, Ishmael quickly became their acknowledged leader, fighting his way to power with an audacity and ruthlessness that commanded their admiration and obedience. It was no small matter to bind so many discordant elements into something resembling a nation, but before Hagar\'s forceful and fearless son was thirty the hard-riding, fierce-fighting savages of the desert were boasting that they were \'Ishmaelites.\' The name was respected and feared, by rulers and robbers alike, all the way from the Jordan to the Mediterranean, all the way from Damascus to Gaza. As time went on, the wild new nation became known as \'Arabia,\' meaning \'Men in Ambush.\' The descendants of Isaac, and his more resourceful but less scrupulous son Jacob, after many misfortunes and migrations—including a long, humiliating period of enslavement in Egypt—fought their way back into their \'Promised Land,\' their western boundary on the world\'s busiest sea, their eastern rim within a sling-shot of the domain controlled by the Men in Ambush. If some stupid stranger inquired, \'Why do the Jews and Arabs hate each other so bitterly?\' he was told, \'It is written in the sacred prophecies of both nations that they are destined to be at enmity for ever.\' It was commonly understood, therefore, that when the posterity of Father Abraham\'s two families met they neither smiled nor saluted. They never broke bread together; never gave aid, no matter how serious the emergency. They conducted their necessary business briefly and gruffly; and, having brought it to a conclusion, turned away and spat noisily on the ground. It was not often that they fought, but it was said that on such rare occasions the catamounts crept out into the open to learn new techniques of tooth and claw. Often the contentious children of Abraham quarrelled; screaming, gesticulating, and reviling; for both of their languages, stemming from a common origin, were rich with invective and ingenious in the contrivance of exquisite insults. Neither nation had ever sent an ambassador to the other\'s court. Officially, neither had ever acknowledged the other\'s existence. Not meaning, however, that there was no commerce at all between these mutually contemptuous men. Racial antipathies had not deterred the ardent traders of both nations from venturing across the Jordan to engage in an undercover barter that would have amazed and enraged the ordinary rank-and-file of their respective kinsmen. Jewish merchants, far travellers by nature, quietly forded the river with pack-trains bearing imports from many distant lands, and did not lack for wealthy Arabian customers when they appeared with foreign fabrics of silk and velvet, fine linens, gold ornaments, precious stones, medicinal herbs, spices, and other exotics. It was customary, on these occasions, for the negotiations to be conducted with all the sullen impoliteness that the everlasting feud demanded; but the expensive goods did change ownership, and the pack-asses skipped home, under a young moon, freed of their burdens. Had either the Jews or the Arabians been gifted with a sense of humour, all this might have seemed funny. During the last score of years something resembling a commercial truce had permitted a group of Arabian camel-breeders to bring their incomparably beautiful and expensive animals to the celebrated stock-show and auction held annually on the disused drill-ground near Jerusalem during the Jewish Feast of Pentecost. Indeed, it was the lure of the Arabians\' superb camels that had lately made this Pentecostal stock-show notable throughout the East. Rich Romans, ever competing with one another in the lavishness of their gaudy turn-outs in the proud processions of the Imperial City, would send their stewards to purchase the finest of these majestic creatures, regardless of cost. The Jews, well aware that this uniquely attractive camel-market was responsible for bringing desirable patrons from afar, tried to forget—for this one day of the year—that the coveted camels were Arabian. And the Arabs who owned the camels pretended they didn\'t realize—on this one day of the year—that they were doing business in the land of Israel. They growled and scowled and spat—but they bought the camels. This camel business, profitable alike to the merchants of Jerusalem and the stock-breeders of Arabia, had come to a dramatic end a year ago. A most unfortunate incident had occurred. The auction, last summer, had attracted an unusually large assembly of well-to-do foreigners. They had come from everywhere: Romans, Egyptians, Damascenes, Cyprians, Greeks from Petra and Askelon. The bidding was reckless and the Arabian camels were bringing unprecedented figures. By custom, the least valuable of the herd were offered first; and so it was that as the afternoon wore on, the excitement increased. In many of the later contests, the spellbound crowd—whose majority had long since been priced out of the market—held its breath in amazement. The finest beast of the lot was not offered until all the others had been bought. This tall, tawny, pompous three-year-old was clearly the pick of the herd. When, at last, the haughty creature was led forward, two well-groomed men, who had taken no part in the previous sales, shouldered their way through the pack from different directions, and showed a serious interest. Not many men in the crowd recognized either of them; but Demos, the suave Greek auctioneer, knew who they were, and was suddenly weak in the knees. The clean-shaven, middle-aged Roman, with the cloth-of-gold bandeau on his brow and the black eagle on the breast of his tunic, was a purchasing agent for Legate Varus, Commander-in-Chief of the Empire\'s Armies in the West. The lean, austere, grey-bearded Jew, in the long black robe, was Joel, the representative of the immensely wealthy Simeon Maccabee, whose political power in Jewry was responsible for Herod\'s strong position on the Judaean throne; for the Maccabee family paid the bulk of the tribute which Rome exacted of the province—and Herod was their man. Commander Varus, who was distinguished chiefly for his high opinion of himself, had become accustomed to getting what he wanted. Simeon the Maccabee entertained a similar feeling about his own desires. It would be a very awkward situation if the representatives of these eminent men staged a battle in which one of them would be defeated. Wars had risen out of incidents more trivial. Demos hastily consulted the Arabians, explaining the gravity of the impasse, and suggested that they withdraw the camel from the sale. Disappointed but comprehending, they consented. The prize camel was led away, and Demos announced that the Arabs had decided, at the last moment, to keep the handsome king of their herd for the continued improvement of their own stock. This left the sons of Ishmael in a very bad spot indeed. The crowd jeered. There was some stone-throwing. The little party of unpopular Arabians were in no position to defend themselves, and they beat an inglorious retreat. Upon their return home, the whole matter was laid before King Aretas, who decided, promptly and firmly, that the Arabs were not again to participate in any of the Jews\' affairs. That had been a year ago. This summer the camel-breeders had let it be known that they were marketing their valuable herd in Damascus. The announcement carried fast and far; and as a result the stock-show at Jerusalem, on the Day of Pentecost, was poorly attended by the people previously counted on to ensure its prestige. As King Aretas sat in counsel with wise old Ilderan, advising him of Herod\'s incredible request for a parley at Petra, the latter had said, after a considerable silence between them, \'Perhaps he wishes to have our camels brought again to his Pentecostal fair.\' Aretas shook his head slowly. \'No, my good Ilderan. It\'s something more important than camels.\' There was no city anywhere quite like Petra. Nobody knew its origin or its age; a thousand years, perhaps. It was known to have sheltered at least four successive civilizations, and had borne as many names. For the past three centuries it had belonged to a wealthy colony of fugitive Greeks, who had expensively bestowed upon it an incomparable beauty. It was Athens minus the slums and the smells. Petra was more than a city; for it embraced not only an exquisitely contrived municipality, distinguished for the architecture of its baths, theatres, forums, temples, and stately residences, but a broad, enveloping valley whose green meadows and fertile fields were nourished by innumerable gushing springs. Nature had also made provision for the defence of this self-contained little city-state by encircling it with a ring of precipitous stone mountains, converting it into a natural fortress. Petra could be entered only through two gateways: on the west, where a deep-worn camel-trail began its ambling toward distant Gaza and the coast-road north to Damascus, and on the south, leading to the Red Sea. These approaches were made through narrow, high-walled defiles which a handful of guards could—and often did—defend against bands of reckless marauders. It had been a long time since the city had had to repulse a serious invasion: never, indeed, since its occupation by the Greeks. Naturally, it had been, through the ages, a much coveted stronghold, populated and repopulated with rich traders of various tints and tongues, whose dynasties successively fattened and fell, each of them leaving monuments and tombs which their victors wrecked to make room for the more extravagant memorials of their own. According to what passed for history in Arabia, which had never gone to much bother about keeping records, the most recent invasion of this territory had been made by their own tribesmen, some five hundred years ago, who had thought it their turn to enter and sack the rich old city, then in the hands of a decadent generation of Nabataeans. At small cost to themselves, the Arabs had driven out all the inhabitants who were left from a ruthless slaughter, had carried off everything of any value, and then had wondered what to do with their new acquisition; for they were nomads and had no use for cities. After an interval of a couple of centuries, during which only the bats and hyenas were in residence, one Andrakos, fleeing for refuge from a Roman invasion with a large company of well-to-do Athenians, offered King Retar of Arabia a great price for the deserted city. Much gratified to have, as neighbours, a new kind of people, who had seen much too much of warfare and might be expected to behave themselves, Retar promised the Greeks that they would never be molested by the Arabians, and published a decree warning his own people that Petra was not to be violated. This injunction they had scrupulously obeyed, not only because King Retar was held in high regard but because the penalty for annoying Petra was a public stoning. Arabia had kept the peace-pact; and, with this comforting guarantee of security, Petra had built the most beautiful city in the world. As for the current relations of Petra and Arabia, it could hardly be said that they had any at all. In the opinion of the Arabs, the Greeks were a queer lot of people who spent their time carving figures out of stone, painting pictures, and reading old scrolls written long ago by men as idle as themselves. Such preoccupations, however unprofitable, were harmless enough, and if the citizens of Petra wanted to fritter away their lives in this manner, it was agreeable with realistic and illiterate Arabia. All that Petra knew about the Arabs was that they raised and rode the most beautiful and high-spirited horses to be found anywhere on earth, that their magnificent camels—too expensive for draught duty—were bred for showy parades in which they marched accoutred with silver ornaments, that the long-fibred wool of the high mountains was eagerly sought by the most famous weavers of Caesarea, Corinth, and Rome, and that their interest in anything artistic was completely non-existent. Aside from the fact that the bodily temperature of the Greeks and Arabs was maintained at approximately the same level, they had nothing in common and regarded each other with a condescension not unmixed with pity. Upon the accession of Aretas to the Arabian throne (a venerable cedar chest covered with the spliced white pelts of two long-haired goats), a richly caparisoned deputation from Petra had come to pay neighbourly respects. For all parties concerned it was a pleasant visit. The pundits from Petra were shown every available hospitality. Their gift to the young King was a richly illuminated scroll containing Thucydides\' History of the Peloponnesian War; and, to show his appreciation, Aretas sent the aged Governor of Petra home on a tall, sleek, snobbish camel named Retar, in honour of the Arabian king who had had such amicable dealings with the Greeks in an earlier day. When, some weeks after the coronation, it was amusingly reported to Aretas that Retar had proved unmanageable, he replied, \'That makes us even.\' Chief Councillor Ilderan, who had something of an instinct for statesmanship and was canny enough to take a long view of international relations, had sometimes urged Aretas to pay a visit to Petra. \'The time may come, sire,\' Ilderan had said, \'when it might be to our advantage to have had a closer acquaintance with these people.\' \'Very well, Ilderan,\' Aretas had replied. \'Sometime we will do that.\' But the young king had plenty of pressing problems on his hands. He had never found time to visit Petra, nor had he any inclination to place himself at a disadvantage in the company of men whose manner of life and thought was so foreign to his own. One day Ilderan, still nourishing the hope for a closer friendship with the Greeks, remarked that Herod and his sons were said to be frequent visitors in Petra. \'That makes me even less eager to go there,\' Aretas had replied almost gruffly. \'If the King of the Jews has found favour with the Governor of Petra—all the more reason why we should keep our distance.\' It was high noon when the Arabian cavalcade by a circuitous route reached the southern gateway into Petra. A brightly uniformed detachment met the expected guests at the pass and conducted them through the fortified defile. After a three-mile ride on a well-kept road, flanked by green pastures, orchards, and widely spaced villas of exquisite architecture, the visitors climbed a long hill, reining in at the summit to face a breath-taking view of the white marble city. There they dismounted to rest their horses. Aretas and Ilderan sauntered a little way apart and for some moments silently surveyed the beautiful panorama below them. King Herod\'s encampment, easily identifiable, had already been set up in a spacious park at the centre of the city. It monopolized at least three-quarters of the park. The colourful tents and gay banners moved Aretas to mutter that it was a more gaudy show than he had expected of the ever dolorous Jews. \'That is the Roman touch, sire,\' observed Ilderan. \'Herod does not forget how he came by his kingship.\' \'Aye,\' rumbled Aretas. \'It was a lucky day for that Idumean upstart when his foolhardy father stopped the Egyptian arrow intended for Cassius.\' \'I have often wondered, sire,\' drawled old Ilderan, \'whether Cassius might have been so generous with his gratitude had he known how much wealth these Idumeans would acquire in Judaea.\' \'It\'s never too late for the Empire to rectify a mistake of generosity,\' said Aretas. \'True—but there\'s no hurry. Herod took over a Jerusalem built of sun-baked brick and is refashioning it in granite and marble. Old Augustus should be willing to let him do that, at the Jews\' expense. Besides,\' continued Ilderan, \'Judea pays an exorbitant tribute. Why should the Emperor send an army in to kill the goose that lays gold eggs?\' \'Even so; Herod\'s nights must be troubled by bad dreams... Shall we proceed into the city, Ilderan?\' The old Councillor did not assent promptly. His brow was furrowed. Pointing toward the Jews\' encampment with his riding-whip, he remarked, \'Herod has occupied all but a corner of the park, sire. Doubtless he expects us to content ourselves with what remains of it. Such an idea would become him, I dare say.\' \'Let us not give him that satisfaction,\' growled Aretas. \'We will pitch our tents where we are—on this hill-top. Agreed?\' Ilderan nodded approval. Beckoning to Zendi, the popular young Captain of the Royal Guard, Aretas gave the order. Noting the sudden disappointment in Zendi\'s face, he added, \'After our camp is in order, you and your men are at liberty to ride down into the city.\' There was a spontaneous murmur of pleasure from the tough young cavalrymen, which prompted the King to announce sternly, \'You will remember that we are guests here. Zendi, you are to hold your men strictly to account for their behaviour!... And—one thing more: there is to be no quarrelling with the Jews!\' Zendi raised his hand for permission to speak. \'Should the Jews attack us, Your Majesty, what shall I tell my men to do?\' King Aretas swung into his saddle before replying. \'In that case, Zendi,\' he said, with a shrug of his shoulder, \'your men will know what to do—without being told.\' There was a concerted shout of laughter. Even Aretas, who rarely smiled, pulled a reluctant grin as he rode away in the lead of his amused Councillors. Ilderan, riding beside him now, resumed their conversation about Herod. \'Of course, sire, he cannot help realizing the instability of his provincial throne. He proves his apprehension by the frequency of his journeys to visit the Emperor—and the fact that his sons spend most of their time in Rome.\' \'The Jews probably object to that,\' surmised Aretas. \'Naturally, sire; but Herod is in greater need of the Emperor\'s favour than the good opinion of the Jews, who would despise him, no matter what he did—or left undone... All that flamboyant display of Roman trinkets represents Herod\'s fear—rather than his admiration—of Augustus.\' On the level now and four abreast, the Arabians quickened their speed and swept through the suburbs of Petra, presently drawing up before the stately palace of Sosthenes, the Governor, where Aretas and his council were ceremoniously received. Sosthenes seemed flustered. \'I trust Your Majesty may find ample room in the park for your encampment,\' he said, with an apologetic smile which Aretas made no sign of interpreting. It was evident that the taciturn King of Arabia, whatever he might think of the King of the Jews, was not disposed to exhibit his feelings for the entertainment of this smooth-tongued Greek. \'And if there is not sufficient camping-space in the park,\' continued Sosthenes uneasily, \'we will see to it that your retinue does not lack for hospitality.\' \'We have already encamped, my lord,\' said Aretas; \'on the high plateau south of the city. Our people prefer the open spaces. Will you advise King Herod that Arabia is at his service?\' \'He awaits you, Your Majesty.\' Sosthenes\' tone indicated his relief that an awkward situation had been nicely disposed of. \'If it is agreeable, your conference will be held here in our council-chamber.\' With a deep bow, he led the way to a high-domed, marble-walled room, luxuriously furnished with huge upholstered divans arranged in two semi-circles fronting a massive teakwood table, at either end of which stood a tall-backed, gold-covered, throne-like chair. The Arabians had not long to wait. Attended by a dozen venerable members of the Jewish Sanhedrin, Herod strutted in. Stiff bows and crisp amenities were exchanged. The Kings took their places in the tall chairs. The Councillors and the Sanhedrin sat. Facing each other, with calm, steady-eyed curiosity, the rulers of Judaea and Arabia presented a striking contrast in costume, bearing, and physique. Herod was urbane, suave, quite the man of large affairs. He was sixty and paunchy, and there were pendulous pouches under his experienced eyes. It was apparent that the paunch and the pouches were decorations won in courageous combat with nourishing food and rich beverages. His abundant thatch of greying hair—close-cropped after the Roman manner—glistened with scented unguents. His beard was short and well-groomed, a compromise between the patriarchal whiskers of Jerusalem and the cleanly shaved jowls of Rome. His robe was of fine-spun white linen, trimmed with purple at the throat, cuffs, and skirt-hem. Herod had the self-assured posture of a man who had been everywhere, and always with the right people; who had seen everything, and always from a reserved seat. Aretas was carelessly dressed in a brown, travel-worn cashmere burnous, the skirt of which was parted revealing his brown goat-skin riding-breeches and thong-laced boots. The only touch of colour on his clothing was the ancient crest of the Ishmaelites, an oval patch of blue silk appliquéd to the left breast of his burnous. In this field of blue were the well-known devices seen on Arabia\'s banners—a slim, gold-embroidered moon-crescent, half-circling a silver star—and pierced, in the form of an X, by a white sword and a shepherd\'s crook, the distinctive symbol of Arabian royalty. Aretas did not relax in his chair but sat rigidly erect with the air of a man accustomed to brief parleys, laconic statements, swift agreements, and an unceremonious adjournment. In his early fifties, Arabia\'s King was lean as a leopard, tough as a bowstring, and as tanned as an old saddle. The hood of his burnous had been pushed back from his deep-seamed forehead, showing a tousled mop of grizzled hair. He too wore a short beard, but nobody had trimmed it that morning, much less anointed it with fragrant oils. There was nothing of smooth statesmanship in the face or bearing of this Arabian. Except for the royal crest, he was not accoutred like a king, nor did he have the manner of one accustomed to the adroit thrust and parry of diplomacy. Yet there were the deep-set black eyes to be reckoned with, eyes inured to long vistas and well-versed in the lore of the sky. Having spent most of his life indoors, Herod—cannily competent in studying the minds and moods of similarly sheltered men—peered into the fathomless eyes of Aretas, and the carefully rehearsed speech he had obviously meant to make seemed to need revision. \'Your Excellency,\' began Herod, measuring his words, \'we invited you here to discuss a matter of grave concern to both our nations.\' He paused for some response; at least a slight lifting of the Arabian\'s brows. But the face of Aretas was impassive, giving no sign of surprise or curiosity. \'We have recently returned from Rome with disturbing news,\' continued Herod. \'Plans are rapidly taking shape for a Roman invasion into the north-east that will sweep this coast so bare of everything valuable that when it is ended the very vultures will die of starvation. Neither of us—and you may be sure that we will both be involved in this tragedy—can hope to withstand such an attack, but, firmly resolved to unite in a defence of our countries, we might exhibit enough force to dissuade Tiberius—\' \'Tiberius!\' broke in Aretas. \'Is Tiberius not leading the Army in the West?\' \'Not at present,\' replied Herod, pleased to be able to instruct his conferee from the hinterland. Tiberius had been recalled to Rome some months ago, to be co-regent with Augustus. The Western Army, in charge of the subjugation of the German tribes and the occupation of all Gaul, was given to Varus, who had now been completely overwhelmed—put to utter rout, destroyed! \'It is the worst defeat that the Empire has ever experienced. Never again will the Romans cross the Rhine. If they are to recover their lost prestige, at home and abroad, they must extend their power in the east—and the north. And our countries are on the highway to Damascus.\' Aretas frowned studiously, but made no reply, though the Jew gave him plenty of time for a rejoinder. Perhaps, mused Herod, the remote Arabian does not fully realize the predicament of the Romans and their necessity to strike a blow—or invite disaster. He decided to post Aretas on some recent history that might have escaped him. The speech lasted for a full half hour, Aretas listening without commenting. Augustus—Herod went on—had made a great Emperor; no doubt of that. In spite of the fact that he never had had any health, at all, he had done much for Rome. But now he was old, and so ill that everybody knew about it. The reins of government had been slipping rapidly through his rheumatic fingers. He had lost his grip on the Senate. The rabble was restless. Of course the trouble was largely fiscal. Gone were the days when—in need of money to finance a fortnight\'s free feasting for Rome\'s improvident thousands—an expedition could be sent to raid Sicily or Crete or Cyprus or Macedonia, returning with valuable slaves, grain, lumber, leather, and gold. True, the provinces could still be sacked and pillaged, again and again; but the Romans had less and less to show for it. \'You remember, don\'t you, Your Excellency, how Augustus was so hard up—a few years ago—that he required every man, in all the provinces tributary to Rome, to pay a poll-tax?\' Herod snorted with disgust. \'It was a paltry thing to do, the act of a miser or a bankrupt. The provinces were already taxed to the limit of their endurance. And then this bewildered old Emperor childishly decides to screw a poll-tax out of the hungry provincials! He sought to clothe the ridiculous affair with dignity by pretending the main idea was to take a census; every man was commanded to report on a certain day, in the place of his birth—wherever that was—and have himself enumerated. But that never fooled anybody. Augustus didn\'t care how many people were controlled from Rome. All he was interested in was their wretched little five farthings. Some of our poor people had to travel so much as a week\'s journey to obey the edict.\' \'I had forgotten,\' said Aretas. \'It did not affect my people. The Emperor would hardly chase an Arabian through the mountains for five farthings.\' \'I\'m not so sure that he wouldn\'t,\' remarked Herod, with a shrug. \'He will—this time! Tiberius will want your sheep and cattle and camels; and your daughters too. There is only one way out for us, Your Excellency. Let us make a treaty—and stand together. Tiberius will think twice before he risks another defeat.\' \'Do you imagine, sire,\' asked Aretas, \'that Tiberius could be made to believe that the Jews and Arabs had concluded an alliance after many centuries of hatred?\' \'I had thought of that.\' Herod hitched at his big chair, which did not move an inch, and leaned forward, lowering his voice to a confidential tone. \'I too had thought of that. Tiberius will need sound proof that out alliance is genuine.\' \'Have you something to suggest?\' inquired Aretas. \'A tangible unity. I am told that you have a marriageable daughter. I have an unmarried son.\' Aretas winced, and shook his head. \'My daughter,\' he muttered, \'would not like that.\' \'Nor would my son,\' said Herod, with equal candour. \'But for what reason are princes and princesses fêted and sheltered; for what reason are they given ices cooled with snow brought from the mountains by swift runners with lungs on fire; and to what end do courtiers bow before them—if not that when the day comes on which they must subordinate their own desires for the good of their country, they shall pay their debt cheerfully and in full?\' \'Perhaps this may apply to your son, my lord, but not to my daughter. She has lived simply, even frugally, as becomes an Arabian of whatever position. Arnon has had no ices in summer.\' \'Be that as it may,\' said Herod crisply. \'Ices or no ices, your daughter loves her country, I think. She would sacrifice much rather than see Arabia laid waste. Nor would she suffer hardship at the hands of my son, Antipas. He is a noble young fellow, gracious, kind, wealthy. They might even come to love each other, though that, of course, is unimportant.\' \'It would not be unimportant to my daughter,\' said Aretas. \'Besides—she is already in love with a young man of our own people.\' Herod stroked his chin with the backs of his plump fingers, and meditated. \'Has her betrothal been announced?\' \'No,\' admitted Aretas. \'That is good,\' nodded Herod. He clapped his hands and an aide appeared. \'We will dine,\' he said. Aretas was not hungry, but it would have been impolitic to say so. The Councillors were in session all night. Aretas set forth their dilemma, expressing it as his opinion that Herod knew what he was talking about and had not exaggerated the threatened disaster. Dumah made bold to say, \'I had rather be enslaved by the Romans than allied to the Jews.\' \'As for you, yourself, yes,\' said Tema, \'but how about your wife and daughters? The Romans are shameless butchers!\' \'But how can we be certain that there is to be an invasion?\' scoffed Dumah. \'This fellow Sosthenes would be directly in the path of it—and he doesn\'t appear to be much upset.\' \'Well, he will be,\' muttered Tema, \'when Herod tells him how much is expected of him—in gold!\' \'Ah—so that\'s why we\'re meeting in Petra, is it?\' queried Adbeel. \'It\'s a good enough reason,\' said Tema wearily. \'No—it\'s quite useless to debate this matter. We\'ve been over all the ground—and there\'s no way out. An alliance of the Jews and Arabians is quite as distasteful to Herod as it is to us. He knows the danger or he would never have made this proposal. We may be sure of that!\' \'It is asking too much of our Princess,\' said Adbeel. \'She will have a wretched life with this young Jewish scamp.\' \'Doubtless,\' agreed Naphish, \'but at least she will live.\' \'I think she would prefer to die,\' muttered Adbeel. \'But that is not the point,\' said Mishma. \'If the Princess marries Antipas she will be saving her country. When this is explained to her, she will consent.\' There was a long interval of moody silence, broken by Jetur, who ventured to raise the question that was on everyone\'s mind: What would young Zendi think of all this? Ilderan was prompt with a reply. \'My son will be deeply grieved,\' he said slowly, \'but he too loves Arabia.\' Aretas nodded his head, without looking up. \'Is there anything further to be said?\' he asked; and when no one spoke, he rose, walked toward the door, and dispatched the fateful message to Herod. The Council adjourned, but not to sleep. Breakfast was disposed of shortly before dawn. The tents were quickly packed. By the time the Jews in the park were astir, the Arabian camp-site on the hill was deserted. The journey home was swift, and for the most part silent. At dusk on the evening of the fourth day of hard travel they separated gloomily. Arnon was anxiously waiting at the entrance to the encampment. Aretas dismounted slowly, heavily; a haggard old man. \'Father!\' exclaimed Arnon. \'What has happened to distress you so? Are you hurt?\' Aretas took her by the hand, as if she were a little child, and silently led her into the tent. When they were seated together on a divan, Arnon summoned a servant and ordered supper to be brought for her father, but Aretas shook his head. Drawing her close, he gazed sadly into her wide, frightened eyes and blurted out the story. Arabia had made an alliance with the Jews. It was the only way of escaping a Roman invasion that would utterly destroy both countries. \'But—if you have made the alliance and have saved our country,\' said Arnon hopefully, \'why are you so downhearted?\' \'Because—the alliance provides for a royal marriage of Arabia and Judaea.\' Arnon gave a little gasp and her face paled. \'Does that mean—me?\' she asked weakly. \'Can you do this, my child, for Arabia?\' Closing her eyes, Arnon drew a long, shuddering breath, and slowly relaxed into her father\'s arms. After an agonizing moment, she straightened and looked up bravely into his deep-lined face. \'For Arabia—yes—my father,\' she said, barely above a whisper. They sat in silence for a little while. Arnon patted him tenderly on the cheek. Swallowing convulsively in a dry throat, she murmured, \'May I go now, father?\' Aretas released her and she walked toward the door of her room with the short groping steps of the blind. He watched her with brooding sorrow. He would gladly have given his life to save her this painful martyrdom. If it was necessary for the Arabs and the Jews to guarantee the genuineness of their alliance by arranging an international marriage it was equally important that the wedding occur without delay, for Tiberius could not afford to wait very long after the catastrophe to Roman arms in the West before attempting elsewhere a recovery of the Empire\'s ailing prestige. Nor was this royal wedding an event that might be conducted quietly. It must be distinguished for its pomp and flamboyant extravagance. The full military power of Judaea and Arabia was to be put on exhibition so that Tiberius, when appraised of it, would realize that these passionate little nations had resolved not only to stand together but had the strength to make their unity formidable. Of course the responsibility for this impressive spectacle would fall more heavily upon Herod than Aretas, for the Arabians were inexperienced in showmanship. At this game Herod was skilled. He had a natural talent for it and his long acquaintance with Roman pageantry had made him fully conversant with its tactics. The big show would be held in Jerusalem immediately after the wedding in Arabia. With amazing speed Herod assembled his widely scattered troops, secured the financial backing of the wealthy guilds, and even won the timid support of Annas, the High Priest, who never liked to take sides in a political issue until sure which way the cat was going to jump. The skeletonized \'Legion\' of Roman soldiers stationed in Jerusalem, ostensibly for police duty but really to keep the restless Jews in remembrance of their provincial status, merely joked about Herod\'s bombastic show, until the habitually sequestered Jewish troops began mobilizing in surprising numbers on the unkempt and disused drill-grounds in the Kedron Valley. Fully accoutred, they were marching boldly through the city, en route from Joppa, Caesarea, Hebron, Jericho, and remote Capernaum in Galilee. That, complained young Legate Julian to his Centurions, was what ailed the Jews: they never knew when they were whipped. The Sanhedrin made deep bows to the Empire\'s representatives, and retired to plot. Every evening at sunset the faithful appeared at the Wailing Wall to howl hopelessly over their subjugation, and strolled back to their cellars to sharpen their knives and spin tougher bow-strings. Apprehensive of a dangerous incident, and anxious to head it off by polite appeasement—for he had been sent to Jerusalem to keep the peace at all costs—Julian went to Herod. Why all these military manoeuvres? Herod smiled innocently. There was to be a wedding, he said. His son Antipas was marrying the young Princess of Arabia. Yes, yes, Julian knew all about that, and said it would be quite agreeable to the Empire, he thought, if a detachment of Jewish patrolmen marched in the wedding procession, but— \'A detachment!\' broke in Herod disappointedly. \'Well—a legion, then,\' conceded Julian, \'if that would better please Your Excellency; but we see no occasion for a parade of catapults weighing two thousand pounds. Is that customary—at a wedding?\' \'It would be an interesting novelty,\' reflected Herod, in a tone of childish wistfulness. \'Many of our people will be surprised to know that we have catapults.\' \'Our people will be surprised too!\' exclaimed Julian. \'And if a large display is made of such heavy weapons, Your Excellency may soon have a more serious use for them.\' Herod smiled enigmatically, patted a yawn, and drummed absently on the table with his knuckles. Julian dourly accepted his dismissal and rose to go. \'In any case,\' pursued Herod, \'they are good catapults, and they are ours, and they are here! It would be no easy matter to bring as large ones, or as many, from Rome.\' Slightly stunned by this unexpected impudence, Julian stammered, \'I am aware of that, sire.\' \'And so is Tiberius,\' added Herod recklessly. \'Meaning that Your Excellency would like me to inform the Emperor?\' \'As you please, Julian. You will anyway, you know.\' This raw arrogance was something new to the Legate, whom Herod had always treated with a suave, if insincere deference. It was evident that the crafty Jew intended to gamble this time for very high stakes. \'The Emperor may suspect that this wedding is primarily a display of defensive armour!\' \'How quick you are, Julian,\' drawled Herod, now candidly contemptuous. \'You are wasted as a mere peace officer. You should be a Consul, at the very least.\' He rose and bowed ceremoniously. \'Forgive us if we have to let you go now. We have another appointment; and you, doubtless, have business of your own.\' As the troubled young Legate made his inglorious exit from the spacious gold and blue audience chamber, Prince Antipas lounged in through the King\'s private entrance. Herod glanced up, nodded amiably, and resumed his writing. His face expressed satisfaction with his favourite son, something of pride too; for Antipas—not always so docile—was showing himself surprisingly co-operative in this affair of the Arabian nuptials. Not meaning that he was enthusiastic—which would have been too much to expect—but quietly acquiescent. Of Herod\'s three sons by his much loved Mariamne, Antipas was his pet. Antipas was respectful, courteous, good to look upon, of better than average height, with a handsome face, an athletic figure, and the confident carriage of a soldier. The firm discipline of the Roman Military Academy was stamped on him. At twenty-five, his slow, agnostic smile gave more than a hint of the fashionable cynicism which characterized the indolent crew of rich men\'s sons who gambled all day at the baths and banqueted all night in the best possible places. Antipas was already an experienced man of the world. As for his other sons by Mariamne, Herod had had but little occasion for pride in them. Archelaus, the eldest, was a contentious fellow, for ever getting himself into embarrassing brawls. Philip, the youngest, whom the family invariably referred to as \'Poor Philip,\' was so listless and impractical that he even had much difficulty in holding the government job his eminent father had found for him in Rome at the cost of much coaxing—and a bit of bribery. And, as if poor Philip were not sufficiently weighted with handicaps, he had allowed himself to be led into an unhappy marriage by Herodias—a cousin twice removed—who was his senior by ten years and a century older in experience. A widow, Herodias had brought along a pert young daughter, Salome, whose adventures were common talk. Herod could not be proud of poor Philip. But Antipas—here was a son worthy of all the costly investments that had been made in him! Noting that his father was occupied or pretended to be, the well-favoured Prince strolled across to the high bank of cases which lined the eastern wall, drew out a new, heavily gilded scroll, read the title, and chuckled audibly. Herod regarded him with interest. \'Did the old man give you this?\' inquired Antipas, amused. \'If you are referring to the aged Emperor Augustus,\' reproved Herod, \'he did.\' \'Gave it to you—personally?\' nagged Antipas. Herod hitched uneasily in his chair, as if to admit that the ostentatious scroll was one of a large number presented to Consuls, Prefects, Governors, Provincial Kings—and Senators too, perhaps. \'I\'ll wager a hundred shekels that Your Majesty hasn\'t read a line of it!\' taunted Antipas; and, when his father had shrugged, added, \'You\'d better, sire. This is Virgil\'s new eulogy to Augustus, extolling his brave deeds. He calls it The Aeneid.\' \'We shall have to peruse it,\' consented Herod absently. \'Indeed you will, sire!\' Antipas made pretence of seriousness. \'You may have to take an examination on it some time.\' He flipped the gaudy scroll back into the case, sauntered to the King\'s dais, flung himself into a chair—and yawned. Herod put down his stylus and smiled benevolently. \'And how are you amusing yourself, my son? We hope the time does not hang too heavily on your hands while you wait for your marriage.\' \'Not heavily at all, sire. Your Majesty will recall that Salome, who is very good company, returned with us on our ship, for a visit.\' \'Specifically—she came to represent poor Philip\'s family at the wedding,\' amended Herod. \'Otherwise she would not have been tolerated—much less invited: you may be sure of that!\' He lowered his voice, discarded his kingship, and impulsively became a father. \'If I were in your place, Antipas, I should arrange not to be seen in public with the little trollop.\' \'My niece, sire!\' Antipas feigned indignation, but his ironical smirk showed through. \'Niece? Nonsense!\' growled Herod. \'Since when did poor Philip\'s notorious step-daughter become your niece?\' \'Technically she is my niece, sire; and Your Majesty\'s grand-daughter. Does that not entitle her to some courteous consideration?\' \'Not from you! The women of the court can attend to Salome\'s wants. The Queen will arrange for her entertainment.\' \'But mother does not care for her,\' said Antipas sadly. \'Not much wonder!\' muttered Herod. \'But—however that may be—you are to have nothing further to do with her. The fact that your half-witted brother married her mother does not obligate you in the least. Your association with this Salome will do you no good, especially now that your heart is in Arabia.\' \'Is it?\' Instantly Antipas realized that he had overtaxed his royal parent\'s patience. He had been sweetly wheedled into returning to wed the Arabian princess. It had required a deal of coaxing. At first he had loudly protested, and his father had promised him an immediate cash payment of his patrimony. He had shaken his head sorrowfully, and his father had conferred on him the Tetrarchy of Galilee. Finally he had yielded to the King\'s importunate pressure. It had placed him in an advantageous position, and he had been trading on it sharply, with all the inconsiderate tyranny of a spoiled invalid. His father\'s dark frown warned him now that his impudence had reached a limit. \'It had better be!\' rasped Herod hotly. \'This is a serious business! And you are a fool not to realize it!\' He rose and paced to and fro, with mounting rage. \'You should be in Arabia at this moment—as I counselled you—making friends with these aliens. I tell you they are no more eager for this wedding than you are! And if you treat it too lightly you may get a dagger between your ribs—blood-letting is a mere pastime with these Arabians! They never forget an injury or an insult.\' The King was breathing heavily as he strode toward the door. \'Don\'t say I did not warn you!\' he shouted. Arnon was given but little time to brood over coming events. Preparations for the marriage proceeded with breath-taking speed. Every day couriers arrived from Jerusalem to inquire of the Princess—or, more correctly, to report to the Princess—what were her wishes in respect to details which, in the opinion of an Arabian, were childishly trivial, but apparently important enough to warrant a laborious journey from the Jewish capital. The vanguard of servants and equipment began to appear in increasing numbers. Long caravans toiled up the tortuous trail from the valley floor, widening the bridle-path to a hard-beaten road. Skilled Arabian seamstresses and weavers worked in feverish haste on the wedding garments for the Princess and her attendants. Tactfully, mercifully, Aretas had dispatched Zendi to faraway Corinth on an errand no less important than the conclusion of a pending deal to lease another large parcel of land in the north to war-weary Greeks. It was a relief to Arnon when Zendi, pressed for time, called to say farewell; both of them glad that the leave-taking was done in the presence of their fathers. Arnon couldn\'t have borne it, she knew, if they had had their final moment in seclusion. Poor Zendi! He had been so determined to deal manfully with his sorrow that he had hardly raised his eyes to hers when they parted. The thousand sheep were led to another pasture, and on their grazing ground an awe-inspiring tented city rose. Soldiers in colourful uniforms made camp with such dexterity and precision that Arnon was forced to admire their skill. They did not squat in small huddles, an Arabian custom, to discuss what procedures were best. They knew exactly what to do. This, thought Arnon, was probably the way everything went in the outside world beyond her untamed but beloved mountains. Though firmly loyal to Arabia and its haphazard way of doing things, she felt a tug of excitement over being made a part of that competent society whose urbane representatives were now demonstrating their disciplined self-assurance. Now delegations of wealthy Arabian sheiks swept by on their sleek horses and entered the tents their servants had prepared on the broad plateau, each contingent accompanied by entertainers: minstrels, magicians, field athletes, acrobats, and comedians. Then came the awaited day of King Herod\'s arrival with Prince Antipas, their tall camels resplendent with costly housings and trappings of gold and silver. Proudly, haughtily, the impressive caravan swung past the encampment of King Aretas and came to rest a few hundred yards away. With fluttering heart, Arnon watched her father and the Councillors greet the party from Jerusalem. It was a dizzying spectacle. King Herod was undeniably a distinguished personage and the Prince was tall and handsome. And there was the High Priest, guessed Nephti, Arnon\'s lifetime nurse, who was holding the tent-panel open to see. Doubtless he had come, added Nephti, to conduct the wedding. \'I had not realized it was to be a Jewish wedding,\' said Arnon. \'The Jews like ceremonies,\' declared Nephti. \'And we don\'t?\' asked Arnon childishly. \'Ours is more simple. If you were marrying Zendi—\' \'Don\'t, Nephti!\' murmured Arnon. \'You promised me.\' \'I am sorry, Princess. I only meant to explain that you would have taken his hand, in the presence of the Councillors, and promised to obey and serve him all the days of your life.\' \'And will I not be asked to obey and serve Prince Antipas?\' \'Of course—but it will take longer, I suppose. The Jews are like that.\' Nephti closed the leather panel as the girl turned aside soberly. Her intuition read Arnon\'s thoughts. These strange people from afar were of immense interest, but they were of another world. \'I had hoped that Queen Mariamne might come,\' said Arnon. \'You saw no women in the party, Nephti?\' No—the whole event was to be a man\'s affair: a political transaction, in which one woman would be included because she was necessary. Gladly would they have done without her, reflected Arnon, if that were possible. The wedding was a confirmation of an international alliance. The treaty had been formally written on a sheet of papyrus, duly signed, and now it must be ratified. Arnon was but so much sealing-wax stamped on an official document. Suddenly she was overwhelmed with a sense of heart-sickening loneliness. That evening there was a banquet attended by the Kings, the Prince, the High Priest, several ranking members of the Sanhedrin, and the Arabian Councillors. After an hour\'s feasting on the part of the men, Arnon was brought in to be introduced. She felt and looked very small and helpless. Antipas stepped forward to greet her. He took both her hands in his and smiled down into her timidly upraised eyes. It was an experienced smile that skilfully appraised and evidently approved. For a moment the silence in the tent grew oppressive as they waited for an opinion from the beautiful young Princess. Presently she gave a shy, tremulous smile—and the suspense lifted. They all breathed freely again; and, with the exception of Aretas, exchanged glances of relief and satisfaction. Herod drained his goblet and smacked his lips. It was good wine. And—what was still better—by this time tomorrow the alliance would be an attested fact and he would be ready—if need be—to confront Tiberius. Now that the month of Tishri had come and the trees were taking on rich colours, Arnon\'s homesickness became almost insupportable. Jerusalem was slowly strangling her. But for the understanding sympathy and tenderness of Queen Mariamne, she would have died or gone mad. Nature had not intended that Arnon should be surrounded by walls. Because her own people were of necessity nomadic they had built no cities. Indeed, the Arabians were contemptuous of cities, considering them pestilent prisons, stultifying to both body and spirit. Every morning, in the far away and long ago, Arnon had risen at dawn to breathe deeply of the invigorating mountain breeze and rejoice in the peace of a silence broken only by the distant tinkle of camel bells. But here in Jerusalem she felt stifled, caged. Late in the morning she would struggle back to consciousness, finding herself hungry for clean, bracing air. The beautifully wrought antique tapestries which curtained her luxurious bed gave off a sickening odour of mould and the exquisite mosaics leaked the sour stench of disintegrating plaster. Added to the tomblike atmosphere of her spacious bed-chamber was a conglomeration of city smells seeping in from the outside, smells of old and decaying things: old walls, old towers, old markets, old stables, old cobbled streets. There were plenty of distasteful sights, sounds, and scents in this ancient city, but the worst thing of all was the stagnant, fetid air. Every day now, Arnon woke nauseated; though the servants—who found nothing wrong with the air—graciously assured the foreign Princess that her morning sickness was due to her condition, always adding, piously, \'For which the Lord God of Israel be praised!\' On this tenth day of Tishri, Arnon tugged herself loose from a nostalgic dream of riding swiftly beside her father in a noisy mountain storm, galloping, galloping hard, quite out of breath, with big splashes of warm rain pelting them. Half-suffocated and drenched with perspiration, she gazed up dully into the smiling eyes of the Queen. Mariamne was the most beautiful woman Arnon had ever seen. She was in her early fifties, but seemed much younger, for by her abstemiousness she had retained a youthful figure. She had all the traditional dignity of a queen, but none of the arrogance. Arnon had known from the first moment of their meeting that she was going to like Mariamne. The Queen had no daughter and Arnon had never known a mother. Their friendship was instant and mutual. But in spite of the affection she felt for her charming mother-in-law, Arnon had extended no confidences. Her father had warned her to guard her tongue in the presence of these people. \'Spies are always friendly, and free to share their secrets with you.\' Sometimes it had been difficult to observe this reticence, her intuition assuring her that Mariamne\'s devotion to her was sincere. \'How are you, my child?\' asked the Queen gently. \'Very warm,\' mumbled Arnon; \'and a bit sick, as usual. I shall feel better when I\'ve had something cold to drink. You are up early, Your Majesty. Have you had your breakfast?\' Summoning a servant to bring the Princess a goblet of cold pomegranate juice, Mariamne sat down on the edge of the bed. \'I am not to have breakfast this morning, my dear. This is a fast day.\' \'All day?\' Arnon\'s eyes widened incredulously. \'Until evening. Then there will be a bountiful feast. You are not expected to do any fasting, but we will want you to attend the banquet.\' Arnon sat up in bed, pushed her tousled black hair out of her eyes, and inquired what this fast was about. \'It is the Day of Atonement,\' explained Mariamne. \'Of all our special occasions this one means the most. It really begins the day before, with all the faithful Jews going about making things right with one another—doing neglected duties, paying their debts, returning things borrowed, and asking forgiveness for wrongs done and hot words spoken. Damaged friendships are mended, estrangements are cleared up. And then today—with clean hands and a right spirit—everyone brings a gift to the Temple and receives a blessing.\' Arnon\'s eyes shone. \'It is very beautiful!\' she whispered. \'May I do it, too? It would be a relief—to go to the Temple and be blessed.\' She bowed her head dejectedly. \'My heart has been so bitter.\' Slowly she raised tear-filled eyes. \'Your Majesty, I have been very unhappy.\' Mariamne slipped an arm around her compassionately. \'Arnon, dear, would you like to call me \\"mother\\" instead of \\"Your Majesty\\"? Don\'t do it if—if it takes an effort,\' she added, \'but it would please me.\' With that, Arnon\'s tears overflowed and she sobbed like a little child. \'I should like to,\' she murmured brokenly. \'You have been so good to me. I want you to be my mother. That\'s the way I think of you.\' Mariamne drew her closer. \'Tell me, Arnon,\' she said softly, \'has the Prince been unkind to you?\' Arnon indecisively shook her head, but the pent-up tears ran unchecked. When she could speak she said, \'No; he has not mistreated me—mother. I see very little of him, you know. But the Prince is a busy man. He can\'t be spending all his time entertaining me.\' \'Men are always busy, my dear.\' The Queen\'s usually placid voice showed a trace of asperity. \'There are the games at Gath and a new Greek play at Askelon—and other important engagements.\' She paused for a moment. Dropping her tone of raillery, she went on, \'Our Antipas is really a sweet boy. He wouldn\'t intentionally hurt a fly. But he is selfish and spoiled. How could it be otherwise? Too much money; too much leisure.\' \'And too many people wanting to win his favour,\' added Arnon. \'Sometimes I have thought,\' said Mariamne soberly, \'that a baby Prince should be left on the doorstep of an honest, frugal, hard-working family and brought up as their son until he is about—\' \'Twenty?\' suggested Arnon, when the Queen had seemed at a loss for the right figure. \'Forty!\' amended Mariamne. \'Then he should be brought to the throne, knowing what his people need. As it stands, there is nobody in the kingdom quite so ignorant of his duties as the ruler himself. He lives in a different world.\' After an interval of silence she asked, abruptly, \'Is anything else wrong, dear?\' \'Almost everything,\' confessed Arnon. \'Everything but you! It may be my own fault. I cannot be myself here. In my own country I am happy and free. I love to ride. The shepherds wave a hand and smile as I pass by and I wave my hand and smile too. We are friends. Their wives and daughters weave gay scarves for me and I visit them when they are sick. Often I stop at their tents and play with the little children.\' \'That is as it should be,\' approved Mariamne. \'And they are not in awe of you, as the King\'s daughter?\' \'They call me \\"Princess,\\" but when we play they do not throw the game away to humour me. Maybe that is what ails a royal family: they are allowed to win all the games... Here in Jerusalem I am a Princess; always, every hour, a Princess. I am unused to these stiff ceremonies—people bowing worshipfully—and backing out of the room. I have to change my costumes half a dozen times a day, and none of them is comfortable. Everything is strange—and I am becoming a stranger even to myself.\' Her voice broke completely. \'Please—may I not go home—just for a little while?\' There was a long delay before Mariamne replied. \'I wish you might, Arnon. Doubtless the King would consent if it were not for this military alliance. If it should come to the ears of the Emperor—\' \'I understand,\' said Arnon weakly. \'Let us think no more about it... And—I should like to go with you to the Temple. Is the Prince going with us?\' Mariamne frowned and shook her head. \'Antipas set off early this morning for the north. You know he has been made the ruler of Galilee?\' \'Yes, mother. He did not tell me, but I heard a friend congratulate him on it, at our wedding. Are we to live in Galilee?\' \'Part of the time, perhaps,\' said Mariamne uncertainly. \'Antipas is a restless fellow. He does not like to stay long in one place. The King is building a Galilean embassy here in the city. Antipas will spend a couple of months every year in Jerusalem, attending to provincial business. He loves Rome, and I dare say he will want to be there occasionally. At the moment he is infatuated with the idea of building a beautiful villa on the western shore of the Lake Gennesaret in Galilee.\' Arnon brightened. \'That would be lovely!\' she exclaimed. \'I have heard so much of that beautiful Sea of Galilee. Perhaps there would be sailing!\' Mariamne did not share Arnon\'s sudden enthusiasm. \'I doubt whether the Prince would be interested in sailing. There are some warm springs on the western shore. Antipas, who loves bathing, will build commodious bath-houses in connection with his villa. I think he hopes to induce a few of his wealthy Roman friends to build villas there.\' Arnon\'s interest gradually faded. Instinctively she gathered that the Queen had thought it time for her to know what manner of life she should anticipate. But perhaps Antipas had not included her in all—or any—of his plans. If he had expected her to live with him in Galilee, he might have inquired what sort of home she would like. \'Has the Prince planned the villa?\' she asked. Mariamne stirred uneasily, reluctant to discuss the matter. \'Perhaps,\' she said. \'He spent all last week in Petra inspecting a few of the beautiful marble villas built by wealthy Athenians. He may have told you.\' \'He tells me nothing,\' said Arnon. Mariamne sighed deeply and rose to her feet. \'If you wish to go with us to the Temple, dear, you should be ready at noon. Your maid will tell you what you are to wear. His Majesty expects to leave the palace promptly at mid-day. It has been announced.\' \'I hope I shall be prepared for the blessing,\' said Arnon wistfully. \'I am much in need of it. Is there anything I should do? I\'m afraid I do not owe anything that should be paid back; and I have spoken no hot words, though I have had them in my mind, which is probably just as bad. Perhaps if my husband were here I might ask him to forgive me for all the unkind things I have thought about him.\' The Queen drew a slow, sober smile and shook her head. \'In that case,\' she said quietly, \'it is just as well that he isn\'t here.\' It was traditionally considered a misfortune in royal households if a titled infant was a girl. The father of the hapless child was expected to be grumpy and the mother was ashamed of herself. But nobody seemed much upset over the sex of Princess Arnon\'s baby; certainly not Arnon herself, whose experience with one Prince had not made her eager to produce another. Antipas was up in Galilee when it happened. But for a handful of servants, he had been spending his time alone. The new villa, on which more than two hundred skilled stone-masons had been engaged for five months, had risen a few feet above the massive foundation. One could easily imagine its oncoming beauty, even in the bewildering clutter of construction. The great oval pool, to be related to the house by a series of graceful arcades, had been completed—all but the mosaic lining, a tedious business, to be postponed until the Prince should be absent for a season. The marble flagging that bounded the pool, the exquisitely sculptured balustrades, and the commodious dressing-rooms were quite finished. Antipas had given much attention to the architecture and appointments of these sumptuous rooms, furnishing them so lavishly that he was using them for his living quarters. The pool had in every way surpassed his expectations. The warm water, reputed to be of invigorating quality, poured generously from stone lions\' mouths in a steady flow that promised to be endless. It was a great privilege, reflected Antipas, to be the ruler of the Province of Galilee. True, he had not yet become acquainted with any of his subjects, nor had he given a moment\'s thought to his executive duties, whatever they might be. He knew very little about the Galileans, except what everybody knew—that they were a stolid, inoffensive, pious people, who minded their own small business and had no ambitions to make their country known abroad. They grew their own grain, wine, flax, and wool. They fished in the Lake Gennesaret. Their men were adept at fashioning articles of household furniture, sometimes showing themselves to be excellent craftsmen. Their women wove serviceable fabrics for domestic uses. Their lives were self-contained and, in consequence, narrowly circumscribed. They almost never travelled beyond their own communities, except on the occasion of the annual \'Passover,\' when considerable numbers of them made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where a week was spent in the performance of religious rites. Customarily they took along some of the products of their lathes and looms, which they offered for sale at the bazaars. They wore no distinctive costume, but were readily identified in the city by their accent and colloquialisms. They were a bit self-conscious and shy in the presence of urbane strangers, aware that they were considered outlanders. Antipas felt that the task of governing these simple-hearted country folk would not be arduous. Doubtless their trivial disagreements would be quietly settled among themselves; and, as for possible entanglements with the other provinces, the Galileans, exporting and importing nothing of any value, would not be likely to invoke judicial aid. He had little or nothing to do; his wealth would enable him to live in luxury. Whenever he wearied of his lethargy, he could easily trek to Caesarea and sail for Rome. Life in Galilee was still a novelty. Antipas had fallen in love with the entrancing view to be had from the eastern portico of the pool. At his command the servants habitually roused him early to see the dawn come in. It was a glorious pageant, with the steep banks of cumulus clouds transformed into symmetrical garlands of gold as the sun illumined them from behind the distant mountain range, while the beautiful Lake Gennesaret—which everybody, except the natives, called \'The Sea of Galilee\'—reflected the deep blue of a further sky. Then would come the dramatic moment when the sun itself would mount regally into the open, stripping the clouds of their gold and arraying them with silver. The slanting sails of the little fishing boats would flash brightly. The tall tower of the Roman fort, a mile to the north, and the squat dome of the Jewish synagogue, a mile further in the heart of Capernaum, would be flatteringly high-lighted. The untidy clutter of fishermen\'s shacks and wharves on the lake-shore would seem less ugly than picturesque. And the ruler of Galilee, suffused with a sense of well-being, would send for his breakfast. Only one thing was lacking, congenial company. And on this eighteenth day of Adar that want was supplied. The arrival of Mark Varus was not a surprise, though Antipas had not expected him so soon. He had promised to come in mid-summer. Attended by half a dozen servants from home and a pack-train of baggage which had been disembarked at Caesarea, Mark had turned up in the late afternoon, warm, dusty, and noisy with his approval of all these impressive building operations. Antipas hugged him with fervour, then picked him up and threw him headlong into the pool, where he wriggled himself out of most of his clothing, his host following along the ledge with a pike-staff, fishing out the discarded garments as they accumulated in the water. Presently, refreshed and clad, Mark joined his friend, who, sprawled at full length on an ornamented lectus, was in conversation with the butler concerning the arrival of a courier from Jerusalem. \'Make him comfortable,\' the Prince was saying, \'and tell him we will see him in an hour or two.\' \'He says it is urgent, sire.\' \'Nothing is urgent—in Tiberias,\' drawled Antipas. \'\\"Tiberias\\"?\' queried Mark lazily, from the adjacent loggia. \'Name of your new villa?\' \'Name of my new city!\' declared Antipas. \'One of the most beautiful cities in all the world. All of it—every building in it—great and small—to be of white marble. You\'re planning to build your villa of white marble, aren\'t you?\' \'Apparently,\' chuckled Mark; \'though I hadn\'t thought much about it.\' \'Are you ready now for a tankard of wine?\' \'I\'ve been ready this half-hour.\' Antipas clapped his hands and the wine arrived. They drank earnestly and their tongues were loosened. Mark was besought for the latest news of Rome. He shook his head dourly. Rome had quite lost her charm: many changes—and all of them for the worse. He did not bother to explain that his eminent father\'s disastrous defeat at the hands of the barbarous Germanic tribes had done the Varus family no good socially; Antipas could—and did—form his own conclusions about that. Mark would be glad enough, he went on, to change his residence. Rome was filling up with vulgar upstarts, rich nobodies busy with business; a strange crowd now at all court festivities. Old Augustus had his faults, to be sure, but he had some dignity. Tiberius had brought in an entirely new breed of favourites. He had made Rome the dullest place on earth. He hated games; considered them a waste of public funds. He was going in for all manner of economies, as if the Empire was on the verge of bankruptcy. \'Well—it is, isn\'t it?\' mumbled Antipas. Mark agreed that it was, and always had been, but it still contrived to carry on. \'This new Tiberian dynasty,\' he continued, \'is going to strip the city of everything that made her name famous. All that we hear about now is the importance of making the land more productive and the common people more contented.\' \'Sounds sensible,\' said Antipas. \'That\'s what ails it,\' muttered Mark. \'How can there be any pleasure in a country that has resolved to be—sensible?\' \'Is Tiberius still thinking of a northern invasion?\' \'He probably never entertained such a thought,\' scoffed Mark. \'I\'m surprised your father was ever taken in by that rumour. The Emperor is working night and day to rebuild his Western Army.\' \'Indeed! I had supposed there was nothing left of it,\' remarked Antipas ineptly. To cover his unintentional rudeness he added quickly, \'So—we no longer have anything to fear? That is good—if you\'re sure you know.\' \'I\'ve had it on the best of authority. You might have been spared that matrimonial alliance with Arabia. By the way\'—Mark\'s eyes twinkled mischievously—\'how has that little treaty worked out? Is she pretty?\' Antipas frowned slightly, shrugged the impertinence away, up-ended his goblet, sat up, blinked thoughtfully, and began slowly counting his fingers. Beckoning to the butler he said, \'Tell the courier we will see him now.\' Presently he was thrusting his jewelled dagger through the wax sheath of a heavily gilded scroll. In silence and without betraying any sign of interest—for he was aware of Mark\'s lively curiosity—he read the formal message from his mother. Signalling the courier, waiting at a little distance, he said casually, \'After you have rested, you may return to Jerusalem. Convey our regards to Their Majesties and our good wishes to the Princess Arnon, for her health and happiness. And you may say,\' he added, as an afterthought, \'that the child\'s name is Esther.\' \'Why do you want her called Esther?\' asked Mark, with childish impudence, when the courier had bowed himself away. \'Because she was born on the fifteenth of Adar, a feast-day in honour of Queen Esther.\' \'Never heard of her. What\'s she queen of?\' \'Persia—a century and a half ago.\' \'Jewess?\' \'Of course.\' \'Why \\"of course\\"? Persia is not a Jewish country.\' Antipas dismissed this query with a negligent gesture, adding that he was not an authority on Persian history; but Esther, a very beautiful Jewess, had once been Queen of Persia, and did Mark want to bet anything on it? \'Is your baby a Jewess?\' hectored Mark. \'Half Arabian, isn\'t she?\' \'That will not matter much,\' yawned Antipas. \'She will be brought up as a Jewess.\' \'In my poor judgment,\' declared Mark, suddenly serious, \'it\'s going to be an awkward situation for her, all her life. A very unfortunate combination—half Arab, half Jew.\' \'Not so bad as you think,\' said Antipas reassuringly. \'Both nations will want to claim her.\' \'You know better than that!\' said Mark. \'Neither nation will accept her, much less claim her! My guess is that your Esther is going to be a very unhappy little girl.\' \'Well,\' muttered Antipas, \'it\'s too late to fret about that now.\' He held up his goblet for refilling. \'Of course, you\'ve no idea how beautiful this pool will be when the lining is in. I\'ll show you the designs after dinner. They are absolutely incomparable!\' Again it was Tishri. The summer was over and the grass was tipped with white in the mornings. Varus had left for Rome, gratified with the Prince\'s assurance that he would be joining him in a couple of months, after he had paid his respects to his family. Arriving home, Antipas had spent a leisurely hour refreshing himself after the tedious journey. Strolling into the Queen\'s apartment as casually as if he had taken leave of his mother an hour ago, he eased himself into a deeply cushioned chair and waited for her appearance. \'Antipas!\' Mariamne threw her arms about him, hugging him hungrily. \'You have stayed away so long! We wondered if we were ever to see you again!\' She held him at arms\' length. \'You\'re brown as a peasant.\' He patted her on the cheek. \'Beautiful as ever!\' he declared. \'How do you do it?\' They sat down together on the divan, Mariamne gently caressing his tanned forearm. \'You\'ve seen Arnon?\' she inquired anxiously. \'Not yet.\' Noting his mother\'s frown, he added, \'Naturally, I wanted to see you first.\' Mariamne accepted the tribute with a wisp of a smile, but grew serious again, shaking her head slowly. \'I think I should tell you, my dear, that your neglect of Arnon has all but broken her heart. You might at least have written her a friendly letter—about the baby.\' \'Sorry,\' muttered Antipas. \'I\'ve been very busy. The villa, you know. I must tell you all about it. You see, when I first thought of it—\' \'The villa can wait,\' said Mariamne crisply. \'In the name of common decency, you should go at once to see your Princess—and this beautiful child, Fara. Come—I shall go with you if that will make it any easier.\' She rose and tugged him to his feet. \'Why do you call the child Fara?\' inquired Antipas testily. \'I named her Esther.\' \'You may call her Esther if you like.\' Mariamne\'s tone was frankly indignant. \'But Arnon has named her Fara!\' \'Against my wishes?\' \'Of course! Why should Arnon pay any heed to your wishes after the way you have treated her?\' \'She is my wife!\' \'Oh—is she? I thought you had forgotten.\' Mariamne was angry now, and her words came hot and fast. \'I don\'t want to upset you, my son, the first hour you are home, but not everyone has forgotten that you married the Princess of Arabia. King Aretas remembers! Your father has had a message from him. He will tell you.\' Antipas searched his mother\'s eyes and swallowed noisily. \'You mean—the Arabian is hostile?\' \'Your father will tell you,\' said Mariamne. \'Come! Better do what you can to make amends to Arnon.\' \'No!\' growled Antipas. \'I shall not be applying for any Arabian\'s pardon—not even Arnon\'s! And if this sullen shepherd, who calls himself a king, has the effrontery to dictate to a Prince of Israel—\' Mariamne held up a hand warningly. \'It is quite apparent,\' she decided, \'that you are in no mood to visit Arnon. Go at once to your father and learn where you stand—in this unfortunate business. I shall tell the Princess that you are here and eager to see her, but that the King has summoned you to an urgent conference. And—let me say one thing more,\' she added, as Antipas moved toward the door, \'it will be much to your advantage if you conduct yourself respectfully in your audience with your father. No strutting, no levity, no assumption that you are a petted favourite of the King!\' \'Angry, is he?\' \'\\"Angry\\" is a very mild word for it! And—don\'t bother to tell him what you have been building in Galilee. The King has other plans for Galilee!\' It was not a happy interview. To begin with, Antipas was halted— politely enough, but definitely halted—at the door of his father\'s audience room, the Chamberlain announcing firmly that the King was engaged. \'But he will see me,\' rasped Antipas. \'Go and tell him.\' \'His Majesty has been notified that you are here, Your Highness. He bids you wait until you are summoned.\' Antipas turned to go. \'Say to His Majesty that I shall return when he is less busy,\' he said indifferently. \'If I may venture a suggestion,\' murmured the obsequious Chamberlain, \'the Prince would be well advised to remain here until he is called.\' Something of warning in the old man\'s tone checked Antipas\' impulsive decision to leave. Indignantly he glanced about for a chair to fling himself into, but to his surprise and annoyance there were no chairs in the corridor. He was about to order one brought to him, but the Chamberlain had already slipped back into the room, closing the door behind him. Antipas paced up and down, fuming. He had never been treated like this before. Once he made up his mind to go, stalked as far as the great door that gave on to the terrace, but thought better of it—and returned. It was a whole hour before the Chamberlain reappeared to say that His Majesty would see His Highness now. Forcing a filial smile, Antipas entered, bowed, and said: \'My greetings, sire! I hope I find you well.\' \'Sit down!\' barked the King. Antipas\' expression sobered and he sat rigidly at attention. It was immediately evident that the King had carefully composed the speech upon which he launched with icy restraint. He had tried, he said quietly, to be an indulgent father. It was not easy for a King—hard pressed with cares of state—to give his children the firm discipline necessary to the production of a strong character. He had paid his sons the compliment of believing that—with their superb advantages—they would develop strength, dignity, integrity. But he had been bitterly disappointed, he went on dejectedly. Where was there a father in all this realm who had less cause for satisfaction in his sons? There was Philip, the weakling, the cuckold! Herod\'s voice shook with contempt. And there was this insufferable braggart and brawler, Archelaus! What had he ever done, the King asked himself, to have deserved an affliction like Archelaus? \'Only last week,\' he went on, with rising heat, \'your impudent brother came to advise us that we were too old to continue our rule: that we had toiled too long, too diligently; that we should retire, and confer on him the regency! Think of that! The regency—of all Judaea! To be conferred upon a loud-mouthed, contentious fellow who can\'t even get along harmoniously with his own lazy drinking-companions!\' Antipas smiled a little reminiscently. Feeling himself to be presently in need of mercy, he thought it opportune to put in a defensive word for his elder brother. Herod, noting that the Prince wanted to speak, paused to listen. \'Archelaus was indeed over-reaching himself, sire; but is it so unthinkable that he should be made regent of Judaea? He is the heir to this throne, is he not?\' \'That,\' snapped Herod, \'is none of your business! We are just now about to come to your business!\' And so—after this considerable delay—they had come to the Prince\'s business, and a bad business it was, too. Antipas, had he the normal instinct of a six-year-old waif, would have known, declared the King, what a dangerous position he had accepted when he consented to be the son-in-law of an Arabian King. Antipas feebly protested that the honour had been forced upon him, but Herod wasn\'t entertaining any mitigating circumstances. \'You have treated this Arabian girl shamefully! What a fool you are—to think that these savages in Arabia who, for all their uncouth manners, have their pride, would let you heap indignities upon the only child of their King! Now you have it to settle for—and in full, mind you. I have had word from Aretas. His message is brief but clear. His daughter is to be brought home to Arabia!\' Antipas raised his head and brightened perceptibly. He drew a long, comforting sigh. His father, observing his relief, rose from his chair and stabbed a finger in the air. \'Mind you\'—he shouted—\'the Princess is to be taken home to Arabia; not sent home. And you, Your Brightness, will accompany her. Aretas insists upon that. His much cherished daughter, he says, has suffered enough at the hands of this court. She is not to be returned like some article of rejected merchandise! Those were his words. Her husband is to bring her home in a manner befitting their station, and show her the honours she—and her countrymen—have a right to expect.\' \'But\'—spluttered Antipas—\'why does he want me to play this farce? He probably despises me.\' \'Indeed he does!\' yelled Herod. \'And not probably! And why shouldn\'t he?\' \'They will kill me if I appear over there,\' muttered Antipas. \'They will kill you if you don\'t!\' \'How long must I stay?\' \'Until you have fully restored Arnon\'s damaged pride; until you have satisfied Aretas and his Council that you respect their Princess as your wife.\' There was a long silence. \'I had expected to leave for Rome,\' protested Antipas. \'I have business there.\' \'That may be,\' snorted Herod. \'But you have no business in Rome that can compare in urgency with the business you have in Arabia.\' \'How about my obligations in Galilee?\' \'You are to forget all about Galilee!\' \'Meaning that you have deposed me, sire?\' \'For the present, yes. We will take care of all Galilean matters. Whether you ever find yourself in Galilee again is a question you may answer for yourself. You may go now. Make peace with your Princess. And prepare to take her home without delay.\' Antipas noisily exhaled a self-piteous sigh, slapped his palms down hard on the arms of his chair, and rose to his feet. \'This, sire,\' he muttered, \'is the unhappiest day of my life.\' \'So far as you have gone,\' assisted the King. \'See to it now that you do not encounter unhappier days. Make things right with your Princess. Tell her how you have longed to return to her, but that a revolt among the people of your Province—\' He broke off, annoyed to find his son attentively listening for further light on this extemporaneous alibi. \'Contrive your own lie,\' he went on impatiently, \'but make it good! Arnon will try to believe you, but she lacks a great deal of being such a fool as her husband.\' \'A revolt, eh?\' reflected Antipas. \'A dangerous uprising; and you had to stay there—and deal with it.\' Herod grew thoughtful and continued, to himself, \'I shall say that to Aretas. He may doubt the truth of it, but a poor excuse in a case so desperate is better than none. When a man\'s pride is injured, almost any medicine is welcome.\' \'May I take my leave now, Your Majesty?\' asked Antipas, with elaborate humility, hopeful that his father might relent and smile a little. \'Indeed you may, Your Highness,\' mocked Herod, with a profound bow. \'What an ass you are!\' The return to Arabia was not as difficult as Antipas had feared. He was regarded with deference. It was obvious that his shameful neglect of the Princess had been a well-kept secret. On the surface Arnon had been treated kindly in Jerusalem. King Aretas received his son-in-law graciously enough, though without any ostentatious amiability, an attitude readily explained by his habitual reticence. The Councillors, promptly assembling to pay their respects, were forced to concede to one another (for none of them knew how badly their Princess had fared but Ilderan and Tema) that if Antipas were not a Jew he would be almost likeable. \'It isn\'t his fault that he\'s a Jew,\' remarked Adbeel. \'No,\' agreed Mishma; \'but it is a great misfortune.\' Arnon had wondered whether there might be some constraint in her meeting with Zendi, but when he called with his pretty wife Rennah, Dumah\'s daughter, the air was instantly cleared for them all by little Fata. Rennah, presently to bear a child, had taken Arnon\'s uncommonly beautiful baby into her arms, while the others, for various reasons, beamed happily over her unselfconscious display of maternal tenderness. They all laughed merrily when Fara laid a small pink palm against Rennah\'s cheek—and smiled. Antipas, who had a talent for making friends easily, was delighted with his daughter\'s charming response to Rennah\'s caresses. \'What an adorable child!\' declared Zendi. \'I never saw her take to any one so quickly,\' said Arnon. \'I\'m quite jealous of you, Rennah.\' \'Beautiful women,\' commented Antipas, \'do not have to be jealous of one another.\' Arnon\'s eyes had brightened at that. There was no doubt now that the Prince was proving to be a good husband. Even Aretas, standing by, seemed gratified. \'They are beautiful,\' he put in unexpectedly, for he was not given to compliments—\'all three of them!\' And so—the return of Antipas to Arabia was made much easier for him than he had expected or deserved. The baby Fara had paved his way. The Arabians came from near and far to see this endearing child whose extraordinary beauty was on everybody\'s tongue. Grim old shepherds, who had bitterly resented Arnon\'s marriage to a Jew, came to see if her baby was really as lovely as the rumour, and found the Prince so obviously devoted to his family that they went away to report favourably. \'He may be a Jew,\' they said, \'but he is doing well by the Princess.\' The ranking Arabians of his own age, suspicious and cold at first, gradually thawed toward Antipas. He was no match for them as an equestrian, but he was by no means inexperienced in the saddle. Respect for him increased almost to friendliness when, invited to join a party on a wolf hunt, he had appeared on a nervous, fidgety, unpredictable filly whose wet flanks showed that she had stoutly disputed his authority. Aretas had told him to select his own horse that morning. Old Kedar had been instructed to assist him. The Prince had looked them over carefully. \'I\'ll take this young bay mare, Kedar,\' said Antipas. Kedar had drawn a long face. \'She needs quite a bit of handling, sire,\' he said. \'I dare say,\' drawled Antipas. \'She probably wants exercise—and so do I.\' Privileged by his age to speak his mind candidly, Kedar chuckled a little, deep in his throat, and replied, \'Well—you\'ll both get it, I think.\' When the young blades, waiting for him on a little knoll, saw him coming at an easy canter, they exchanged knowing grins. Approaching, Antipas dismounted. \'The girth is a bit tight,\' he remarked, loosening it with a practised hand. \'It annoys her, I think.\' Everybody laughed companionably. \'It doesn\'t take much to annoy that filly,\' said Zendi. \'Have any trouble with her, sir?\' \'Nothing to speak of,\' said Antipas. He patted the perspiring mare on her neck and gently tousled her forelock. \'You\'ll be a good girl now, won\'t you?\' he murmured kindly. The filly tossed her head; but apparently thinking better of it, rubbed her muzzle across his arm. They all laughed again. Antipas was getting along very nicely with the Arabians. Winter closed in. It was rather hard to bear. The days were short and cold and uneventful. Sometimes Antipas would talk to Arnon about Rome, and she would listen with wide-eyed interest, thinking to please him. When the first hardy little edelweiss peeped through the melting snow, he suggested that they plan a trip to Rome—not to stay very long. He knew she would enjoy the voyage, he said, and she would be interested in seeing this greatest of all the cities in the world. Arnon demurred at first. She would like to go—but there was little Fara. We will take her along, said Antipas. That would be difficult, said Arnon. Then leave her here, said Antipas; she has an excellent nurse and we will soon be back. Do think it over, he implored, adding wistfully, \'I am really a city-bred man, my dear—and it has been a long time since I have been on a paved street.\' \'He has done very well, Arnon,\' said her father, when she consulted him for advice. \'Much better than we had thought. Perhaps you should humour him.\' \'I\'m not very happy in a big city,\' said Arnon. \'And your husband is not very happy in the open country,\' said Aretas. \'Better meet him halfway in this matter. Otherwise he may grow restless here.\' She nodded her head. It was good counsel. Antipas would grow restless here. She did not add that Antipas was already so restless that it was making him moody and detached. No one could have been more graciously attentive than was Antipas on their long voyage from the port city of Gaza to Rome. The early summer weather was perfect for sailing, the little ship had better accommodations than most and the ports of call were of fascinating interest. Arnon could not be quite sure whether the Prince\'s good humour and high spirits represented his desire to make her contented or could be accounted for by a boyish anticipation of a return to his enchanted city. She gave him the benefit of the doubt and enjoyed the comfortable journey. Antipas spent long hours, on lazy afternoons under the gay deck-canopy, discoursing on the life he had lived in Rome and the friends to whom he would introduce her. But the more he talked, the less confidence she had in her capacity to find pleasure in the pursuits of such people as he described. Did they ride? she asked. No—there really was no safe and quiet place to ride unless one lived on an estate in the country. But—couldn\'t they do that? inquired Arnon. Antipas had whimsically wrinkled his nose: he had had quite enough of country life for the present. But—wouldn\'t it be frightfully noisy in the city? Doubtless; but Antipas didn\'t object to the sound of traffic; it made him feel alive. One day she asked about the language of Rome. Latin, wasn\'t it? Perhaps Antipas would teach her. No, Antipas had replied, they did not speak Latin; that is, it was spoken only by the lower classes. \'Everybody who is anybody,\' he went on, \'has had private tutors, and these men are invariably Greeks—Greek slaves.\' \'The better people are taught by slaves?\' \'My dear, our Greek slaves are the most intelligent men in the world. We Romans do not pretend to match them in learning.\' \'\\"We Romans\\"?\' laughed Arnon. \'You are not a Roman, are you?\' Antipas had glanced about, before replying in a guarded tone, \'I am Jewish by race, but Rome is my city.\' Rearranging Arnon\'s pillows for her better comfort, he reverted to the language question. \'You will pick up the Greek quickly, I think. You may speak with an odd accent at first. Most foreigners do. That is to be expected. But the Romans will find it charming. It always amuses them.\' Arnon smiled uncertainly. Of course she knew that she would be considered a foreigner, but the word made her lonely. And she would speak queerly, and it would amuse them. Doubtless they would treat her as a child learning to talk. She wouldn\'t like that. Some women were at their very best—playing they were six, prattling baby-talk, but Arnon had been taught to despise such silly affectations. Now she would be forced to do the baby-role, for which she felt temperamentally unfitted. She frowned thoughtfully. If she had been at a disadvantage in Jerusalem, where at least she could talk like an adult, how would she feel in Rome? It worried her so much that she asked the question of Antipas who, summoned from his day-dreaming, replied absently, \'You will not feel strange—after a day or two.\' But she did. The great, garish, clamorous city bewildered her. The elaborate house to which Antipas brought her was conducted in a manner utterly unfamiliar. She had such difficulty in making the servants understand her wishes that she soon gave up trying to be the mistress of her home and allowed the score or more of slaves to run the establishment as they pleased. Often they were drunk, always they were lazy; it was suspected that the butler was dishonest. The meals were late and indifferently served. The rooms were untidy. Antipas coolly remarked that he had never lived less comfortably. He did not say it was Arnon\'s fault; but whose else could it be? Their first social evening out was at the home of Mark Varus. Antipas had reminded Claudia that his Arabian Princess would be having language difficulties which might make her seem ill at ease, and would Claudia limit the number of her guests to a very small company who could be depended on to understand Arnon\'s predicament. So Claudia had invited only twenty. The first person to be introduced was Arnon\'s sister-in-law, Herodias, who spread a wide, red mouth, nodded gaily to her new relative—as if they had known each other since childhood—and threw her long, slim, jingling arms around Antipas\' neck, drawing him to her in a daring embrace. Lagging behind Herodias was a sheepishly grinning, baldish man whom Arnon readily guessed was Poor Philip. He advanced shyly and spoke in Aramaic. \'Thrice welcome, Princess Arnon, to this overestimated city. I am Philip, the pampered husband of that lady who is so firmly attached to my brother. We are, as you see, a devoted family.\' Arnon smiled at this persiflage, but couldn\'t help feeling shocked over Philip\'s indifference to his wife\'s sluttish behaviour. \'They must be very warm friends,\' she said, trying to be casual. Claudia had turned away to greet arriving guests. Herodias had eased her grip on Antipas and was whispering earnestly into his ear. Mark Varus, flushed and lusty, approached to say—in Greek, \'So—at last—we have the lovely Princess of Arabia with us!\' Arnon smiled, only half understanding. \'Her Greek isn\'t very nimble yet, Mark,\' said Philip. \'Know any Aramaic?\' Mark said \'Very little,\' and proceeded to prove it by discoursing, in extravagant terms, of the new villa in Galilee. Arnon, who knew less about the villa than Mark knew about Aramaic, could only say that she hoped to see it, some day. Mark\'s intuition suggesting that this topic might profitably be dropped now, he offered her his arm and led her—with a proprietorial swagger—among the groups of guests, introducing her to faces rather than names. Arnon had a feeling that no one knew who she was or cared very much. They smirked, nodded, and continued their loud-pitched conversations in which three or four women seemed endeavouring to talk one another down. Arnon was stunned by the confusion. She had never been in a place so astoundingly noisy or so appallingly rude. Mark Varus continued to drag her about in a manner that made it difficult to maintain any dignity at all, as if he were exhibiting a blooded colt, pinioning her arm tightly under his, while he gaily shouted greetings to new arrivals. Arnon turned about to look for Antipas, but he was lost in the crowd; probably had forgotten her. Presently an elaborate dinner was served, the guests lounging languidly on an elbow in the deep upholstery of divans drawn close together about a long table. Mark, seated next to Arnon, was most attentive, embarrassingly attentive, finding frequent occasion to bend over her in an effort to serve her plate personally with some delicacy. She instinctively drew away from these intimate contacts; and Mark\'s ardour, after a few unmistakable rebuffs, suddenly cooled. Turning from her, he attempted to attract the attention of Herodias on the other side, but finding her wholly preoccupied with Antipas, he laboriously resumed his attention to the Arabian Princess, scolding her gently for her abstinence. Arnon tried to explain that it was not a custom among her people to drink intoxicants. Sometimes, she said, their men had a glass of wine, but it was not considered suitable for an Arabian woman to drink at all. Philip, who was seated next to her, overheard the conversation and leaned forward to remark that one was expected to drink deeply at Roman banquets. \'It annoys half-drunken people,\' he went on drolly, \'to talk to anybody who remains sober. It embarrasses them. That\'s why Varus presses you to imbibe, Princess Arnon. He means it well enough. He is your host—and he wants you to be a social success.\' Mark listened with a frown, but made no comment. \'And I won\'t be a success—unless I\'m a little bit drunk?\' inquired Arnon. \'Well,\' drawled Philip, with a chuckle, \'that\'s one way of saying it—but I never heard it put so briefly and clearly before.\' He caught Mark\'s eye and was rewarded with a scowl and a shrug. \'I\'m afraid I am not going to like it very well—in Rome,\' murmured Arnon. It was some time before Philip commented on that. Regarding her soberly, he said, \'No—you couldn\'t. My brother should not have brought you here. You are of a texture much too fine to be soiled with this degradation.\' For an instant Arnon searched Philip\'s eyes, suspecting that he was taunting her, but found him seriously sincere. \'Perhaps you too would be happier—somewhere else,\' she said. \'Anywhere else,\' he replied. After a few weeks of earnest but unsuccessful endeavours to accommodate herself to the mores of Rome, Arnon gave up trying and begged Antipas to excuse her from further attendance at banquets. \'And am I to spend my evenings at home, then?\' he demanded testily. \'Is it your idea that I should live the life of a hermit in a cave?\' There was only one reasonable answer to that. Arnon assured him that he was quite free to go alone, whenever and wherever he pleased; which he did. It was not long before they were seeing very little of each other, making no effort to repair their estrangement. One evening in early autumn when Arnon was about to sit down to a solitary dinner, Philip surprised her by calling. She insisted upon his dining with her, and he seemed glad to accept. She found it easy to talk with Philip, whose reticence everybody mistook for stupidity. It was not long before the conversation was becoming quite personal—by mutual consent, for they were both lonely. Arnon\'s life in Rome, Philip was saying, must have turned out to be very tiresome. Tiresome, said Arnon, wasn\'t the word she would have used, but it was at least that. \'Sometimes,\' declared Philip dreamily, \'I can hardly endure it. I have often thought of running away—to Sicily, perhaps, to live alone\'—he seemed talking to himself now, with eyes half closed— \'in the country, in a little house, on a green hillside, with fruits and flowers to cultivate, trees, grass, sunsets, and a friendly dog or two.\' \'But would you be happy—without your family?\' asked Arnon, when he had ended. \'I have no family,\' he muttered. \'Herodias is never at home. I do not ask where she spends her time.\' \'Why don\'t you?\' ventured Arnon. \'She is your wife.\' \'For the same reason that you do not ask Antipas where he spends his time,\' said Philip. He chuckled unpleasantly. \'I dare say that if we inquired of their present whereabouts we would find them in the same place.\' \'You mean—they are often together?\' \'They are always together! And if I were you, Arnon, I should leave for Arabia at once—before this scandal humiliates you—and your people.\' Arnon\'s heart beat hard and her throat hurt. \'I think that was why you came to see me tonight,\' she said weakly. \'You thought it was high time for me to know.\' Philip nodded, without meeting her eyes. \'Everyone else knows,\' he said. \'Why shouldn\'t you?\' Next morning the unavoidable interview between Antipas and Arnon terminated their unhappy alliance. To his considerable relief, the Prince\'s scandalous behaviour was not discussed. Arnon simply stated that Rome was no place for an Arabian Princess to hope for happiness, and Antipas cheerfully agreed that her return to her own people was the only solution to their problem. He would arrange for it without delay. A well-appointed pleasure barge was chartered, stocked with everything that might make the long voyage comfortable. A score of trusted men, experienced in handling caravans, were engaged to safeguard the overland journey from the port at Gaza. On the day before the sailing, Antipas tried to turn the conversation toward the probable attitude of King Aretas. Reassuring Arnon on the wisdom of her decision to return home, he added pleasantly, \'And how pleased your father will be to have you come back to him! I am sure he has been lonely without you.\' Arnon frowned, pursed her lips, and stared squarely into his uneasy eyes. He shifted his position and made a pretence of casualness. Slowly lowering her head, she continued to search his face from under her long lashes. She gave him a slow, enigmatic smile. \'My father will welcome his daughter\'s return to his tent,\' she said, measuring her words. \'But Aretas, the King of Arabia, may not be pleased when he learns that the Princess of Arabia has been put to shame by an alien enemy.\' \'Meaning that he will seek revenge?\' Antipas was serious now and his voice was unsteady. \'Prince Antipas is not well versed in Arabian history,\' replied Arnon, \'if he thinks that this indignity might be easily overlooked.\' The implied warning disposed of the Prince\'s suavity and self-assurance. He paced the floor, flushed and angry. \'Let the King of Arabia do what he will!\' he shouted. \'Doubtless the Princess will put the worst possible construction on her difficulties. She will not tell the King that she made no effort to fulfil her obligations to her husband.\' He paused in his march and regarded her sternly. \'I have not injured you! On the contrary, you are abandoning me! And I may as well tell you now that when your ship has sailed tomorrow I shall execute a bill of divorcement—on the grounds of desertion!\' Arnon suddenly sat erect. Her eyes lighted. \'Do you really mean that?\' she exclaimed. \'Accept my thanks, Antipas, for this gracious favour!\' Stunned by this unexpected blow to his vanity, he studied her eyes soberly. No—she was not ironical. She meant it sincerely. He had hesitated to hand her this crushing news—and now it was evident that she was delighted to receive it. He bowed stiffly and walked toward the door, where he turned for a final word. \'You will find on the barge a young, well-born Greek slave, whom I bought yesterday at considerable cost. She is your personal property. I hope you will take her with you. She reads, writes, and speaks Greek fluently. In addition to her other duties, perhaps she will teach my little daughter a more graceful language than the crude imitation of Aramaic that is spoken in Arabia.\' Arnon flushed a little. \'Whether our language is crude or not,\' she retorted, \'depends on who speaks it! And—I want no parting gift from you.\' \'As you like,\' said Antipas indifferently. \'The Greek slave will be on the barge, and she is your property. If you do not want her—pitch her overboard.\' The Prince did not appear when the ship sailed. Arnon had not expected him, and was not disappointed. At the last minute before the hawsers were hauled aboard, Philip arrived in a surprisingly happy mood. He led her a little way apart on the afterdeck for a final word. \'This is a good day for you,\' he said gaily—\'and for me too! You are going home to people who love you, freed from everything that has made your life unpleasant.\' \'And you?\' queried Arnon. \'I too am free! Herodias has informed me that she and my brother want to be married; and would I divorce her. Would I? I do not often move with so much alacrity. And I am sailing in a week, for Sicily.\' \'How fortunate you are, Philip,\' said Arnon. \'I do hope you will be contented there. I shall often think of you—in your garden.\' She lowered her voice. \'The Prince may have told you that he is divorcing me.\' Philip nodded. \'I was gratified and a bit surprised that Antipas found the courage to tell you himself. My brother has always disliked to admit that he is a scoundrel.\' After farewells were said and the ship had cast off, Arnon was conducted to her commodious cabin, where an uncommonly bright and pretty young woman, of nearly her own age, was unpacking her boxes. She had quite forgotten about the slave. The girl made a deep curtsey, with eyes timidly averted, and continued with her task. \'I am told that you belong to me,\' said Arnon kindly. \'What is your name?\' \'Ione, Your Highness,\' said the girl, with another obsequious curtsey. \'You may address me as \\"Princess Arnon\\"—and you need not curtsey. Are you a good sailor?\' \'I do not know, Princess Arnon.\' \'But this is not your first voyage?\' \'No, Princess Arnon. I was brought to Rome from Piraeus in a slave-ship when I was only ten, but we were crowded down deep in the hold, where it was always dark and there was no air. I was very sick, all the time. Perhaps I may do better if—\' \'If you are allowed to breathe,\' assisted Arnon. \'We will see to that.\' She smiled reassuringly, and the girl\'s eyes softened. \'It will be a long voyage,\' she added. \'I am taking you to Arabia.\' \'I am glad, Princess Arnon,\' murmured Ione. \'You are not sorry to leave Rome? You will not be homesick?\' \'I have no home, Princess Arnon. I am glad to leave Rome. I shall be happy in Arabia.\' \'But you were never in Arabia,\' said Arnon, amused. \'No, Princess Arnon,\' said Ione, \'but I know I shall be happy—if you are there.\' The caravan wearily drew up before the King\'s encampment at sunset. Old Kedar was much moved as he helped Arnon out of the cramped camel-housing, lifting her down as if she were still a little girl. Word spread rapidly that the Princess had come home. Nephti met her at the door and tenderly placed the baby Fara in her arms. Arnon\'s eyes were misty as she looked down into the child\'s smiling face. The servants gathered about, making soft little murmurs of fond delight. The Princess inquired for her father. \'The King should be here soon,\' said Kedar. \'They buried the good Chief Ilderan this afternoon.\' As the twilight came on, Aretas arrived, sober and moody over the loss of his great friend. Arnon\'s presence comforted him, but he was impatient to learn why she had been brought back by strangers. She tried to spare him, tried to take most of the blame, tried to temper his rising anger; but he demanded the full truth, and she told him everything. Aretas did not eat or sleep that night. Next morning, well mounted couriers were dispatched in all directions with messages to the Councillors tersely telling the story. The Councillors, in turn, sent word to their tribal sheiks that an expedition would move at once upon Jerusalem. A mobilization of cavalry was ordered, the concentration to occur on the east bank of the Jordan near the village of Jeshimoth. By the fifth day two thousand armed horsemen were assembled. The violent rage that had swept Aretas was not apparent now. That fire, still dangerously hot, had been banked. When the King spoke to his impatient troops he was composed. Arabia had suffered a great humiliation at the hands of the Jews. A swift and savage blow was to be struck at Herod, seeing that the despicable Prince Antipas was out of reach. The Arabians needed no urging. They were so eager to proceed that the Councillors postponed the election of a successor to Ilderan. Indeed, it was with much difficulty that Aretas detained the vanguard until the contingents from far distances had arrived. Young Zendi would have taken a score of his reckless neighbours on ahead of the others had not Aretas spoken to him sharply. \'You may be the ruler of these brave men, some day,\' he said, \'and it is not too soon to let them know that you have not only a courageous heart but a cool head.\' When the eagerly awaited order was shouted on that eventful morning they bounded away to the west, forded the river, scrambled up the bank into Judaea, galloped four abreast across the plain, through the startled villages, over the highways, into the palm-bordered avenue that bisected suburban Bethany. They dashed down the long hill from whose top the turrets and spires of Jerusalem shone brightly in the noonday sun. Still four abreast, they rode through the massive open gates, a score of bewildered guards and revenue officers scattering before them. They proceeded at full gallop through the narrow, winding, crowded streets, indifferent to the shouts and screams of the panic-driven crowds that scurried for safety in doorways and alleys. Now they had reached Herod\'s imposing palace, the Insula, where they drew rein. Lining up in precise ranks that filled the spacious plaza fronting the huge marble Insula, they dismounted from their wet horses and stood waiting while Aretas and the Councillors rode up the broad white steps and across the stone-floored terrace and up another flight of steps toward the impressive bronze doors. A thousand Roman legionaries stood guard, but had received no order to obstruct the mounted Arabians. Perhaps the Legate was stunned out of his wits by the sheer impudence of these grim horsemen who had dared to ride up to the very doors of the Insula. It struck Aretas strangely that so large a force guarded the King\'s palace. Surely he had had no word that the Arabians were making an invasion; or, if he had ordered out his troops to repel an attack, why were they standing there motionless? Aretas shouted to the Legate, who approached respectfully. \'Take me to Herod!\' he demanded. \'King Herod is dead, sire.\' \'Have a care,\' shouted Zendi. \'It is dangerous to lie to the King of Arabia!\' \'I have told you the truth, sire,\' reiterated the Legate calmly. \'King Herod died of a shock early this morning.\' He gestured toward his troops. \'This is a Guard of Honour.\' \'Open those doors!\' commanded Aretas. \'I came to see Herod and I mean to see him—alive or dead!\' After a brief parley, Legate Julian gave the order. The great bronze doors slowly swung open. The mounted detachment moved forward. \'But, sire,\' protested the Legate, \'I hope you are not going to ride your horses into the Insula! Surely you would show more respect for the King of the Jews!\' \'Stand aside!\' growled Aretas. \'I am not here to show respect!\' They rode into the marble-lined palace, down the broad corridor, inquired of a frightened sentry where Herod\'s body was to be found; and, upon learning that it was in the Council Chamber, proceeded to ride into the high-domed, beautifully appointed room. In the centre, on a bier, reposed the King of the Jews. The military guard, numbering a score, stood their ground. Forming a circle about the corpse, the Arabians sat for a long moment in silence. Aretas pointed his riding-whip toward the waxen face. \'It is clear we cannot take revenge on that!\' he said calmly. \'And we have no cause to hew the Roman legion to pieces. And there is no Jewish army to fight.\' Aretas dismounted and the Councillors followed his example. With bridle-reins in hand, they stood in a circle around the bier and held a conference. All were agreed that there was nothing further to do in Jerusalem. Dumah, dissatisfied, suggested that they hang Herod\'s body to a tree in the courtyard. Mishma—who was expected to be appointed Chief of the Councillors—objected to this on the ground that it wouldn\'t be dignified. \'It would be as dignified,\' said Dumah, \'as what we are doing now!\' For Mishma\'s bay mare had taken a step forward and was inquisitively sniffing the grey feet of the late king. Everybody chuckled. Even Aretas grinned. They mounted their horses, rode out of the Council Chamber and down the corridor and out into the warm sunshine. A report was made to the cavalrymen. They were instructed to be at ease and do what they liked until sunset. Disappointed and disgruntled, they rode back into the business zone; and, after the manner of idling soldiers, made a nuisance of themselves in the shops and markets. No serious damage was done. One indignant old goldsmith remarked, \'Kindly leave your horses outside. You are welcome—but we have no accommodation for horses.\' The Arabians thought this was funny and laughed heartily at the joke as they rode about through his bazaar, examining the expensive merchandise. Pleased that the Arabs did not loot his store, the goldsmith cheerfully answered all their questions. \'How do you happen to be doing business today?\' they asked. \'We\'ve had no order to close up,\' replied the old merchant. \'You know that King Herod is dead, don\'t you?\' \'Of course.\' \'Sick very long?\' \'Hadn\'t you heard?\' \'Heard he was dead—that\'s all.\' \'There\'s more to it than that! Prince Archelaus arrived from Rome last night, and he and the King quarrelled. Somehow the Prince was stabbed—accidentally, they say; and the King had a stroke—and died.\' The Arabians stopped browsing about the shop and surrounded the goldsmith inquisitively. Was the Prince badly hurt? Yes; he was said to be dying. As the afternoon wore on some of the cavalrymen managed to find some wine, which gave them renewed interest in their mission of vengeance. They rode their horses into the lobby of the Temple, tore down several exquisitely wrought tapestries from the walls, and set fire to the High Priest\'s palace. But as for revenge—no one was satisfied. That could come later—when they had access to Antipas. He was the ruler of Galilee and would eventually return to his domain. Some day, they declared, a few picked men of Arabia would pay him a visit. At dusk they set off in the moonlight for their homeland. Next morning, as if the expedition had not already acquainted itself with a sufficient number of unusual incidents, the King\'s white stallion misjudged the width of a cross-country wall and pitched his rider violently to the ground. They hurriedly dismounted and gathered about him. Aretas was dead. Improvising a litter made of young saplings, they slowly bore the body toward home. That evening they camped on the plain near Jeshimoth. After their supper, eaten in silence, the troops assembled to hear Mishma confer the Kingship of Arabia upon Zendi, the son of Ilderan. To the satisfaction of Arabia, young Zendi dealt quite generously with Princess Arnon. This he could well afford to do, for he had inherited from his father Ilderan large flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and enough camels to outfit a dozen caravans on their regular journeys to the sea. It was his right as the new King to take over the entire domain controlled by Aretas, but he immediately asked the Councillors to cede a tract of the King\'s land to the Princess for the pasturage of livestock bequeathed by her father. In view of the sympathy which the Arabians felt for their unhappy Princess, this warm-hearted display of kindness greatly advantaged the boyish monarch as he entered upon his duties. And it was clear that he would stand in need of his country\'s loyalty, for but little snow had fallen during the previous winter and the competition for grazing grounds would demand firm and wise control when the midsummer sun had made the problem serious. By this magnanimous act, Zendi had made a good beginning. Even Mishma, who had come so nearly being the new king himself, expressed his belief that Arabia was in competent hands and gave the son of Ilderan his full support. With the approval of the Councillors, Arnon\'s establishment was set up on a broad plateau two miles south of the King\'s encampment, and it seemed very much like home, for she was entitled to all the furniture and household retainers belonging to her father. At Zendi\'s gracious suggestion, the royal ensign fluttered at her imposing entrance door and its replica was embroidered on her apparel. \'And Fara is to wear the royal crest on her clothing too,\' Zendi had added, much to Arnon\'s delight. So many internal problems were distressing the King, the Councillors, and the tribal chieftains as this trying summer wore on, that the question of an immediate avenging of Arnon was abandoned. Affairs in Arabia were quite difficult enough without the added risk and responsibility of setting forth on a punitive errand requiring their best men and much valuable time. Word had drifted in that Prince Antipas and his disreputable wife had taken up permanent residence in Galilee. Very good, said Arabia. We will know where to find him. Let him be patient and wait our convenience. A few of the more hot-headed young blades, still disgruntled over the recent fiasco in Jerusalem, demurred at this postponement, maintaining that the honour of Arabia was at stake and that any delay to deal out retribution might be interpreted by the Jews as a sign of indifference—or worse. To soothe the indignation of their reckless sons and nephews, the Councillors prepared an imposing statement of intent to right this wrong, which any impatient young Arabian might sign—and act upon—whenever he wished. In the King\'s main tent, where all state business was conducted and Council meetings were held, there was a massive oak table elaborately carved with devices relating to the interests of herders and shepherds. This venerated table had long served as the equivalent of a throne. Nobody remembered the name of the craftsman who had built it, for he had been dead at least three centuries, but it had been in uninterrupted use as a symbol of executive authority ever since the reign of the fabulous Terah, whose deeds of strength and skill had inspired the minstrels for many generations. On this table were laid documents of high importance: petitions to and edicts of the Councillors and decrees of the King. After much deliberation, the Councillors drew up a formal vow, impressively lettered in colours, stating that the undersigned hereby pledged himself to avenge the Princess Arnon by destroying Antipas, the Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea. The avenger was to choose his own time and manner of fulfilling his vow. It was his responsibility to decide whether he would perform it clandestinely and alone or with the voluntary assistance of others. But once he had pledged to do it, the task was in his hands and Arabia would expect him to keep his promise, whatever the cost. The heavy sheet of papyrus was ceremoniously placed upon the table and the word went forth that it was there—with a stylus and inkhorn beside it—for any man to sign who felt urged to do so. But the blazing sun continued to scorch the grass, and every man was fully occupied with the desperate search for pasture to save what remained of his decimated flocks. Everybody agreed that the contemptible Antipas must be put to death, but he would have to wait for it until Arabia saw better times. To Arnon, this tardiness to wreak vengeance upon Antipas was of small concern. It would be a dangerous business and whoever attempted it would almost certainly lose his life, for the stronghold in Galilee would be well guarded by the man who doubtless lived in fear of a reprisal. Quite enough unhappiness had already resulted from Arabia\'s pact with the Jews. She said that to Zendi, upon learning of the vow that the Councillors had prepared. \'I do not want to be responsible for any more trouble,\' protested Arnon. \'Why not let the matter rest?\' And Zendi had agreed that her suggestion was sensible enough, but added that all Arabia would sleep more comfortably when Antipas slept without prospect of waking. There were some encouraging rains that autumn, much too late to benefit the burned pasture-lands, but giving promise of better fare next season. The winter, however, was bitterly cold and the snow alarmingly scanty. The Arabian shepherd was not without his superstitions, nor was this fascination for the supernatural limited to the custody of lonely men who guarded their flocks in outlying regions, where fears and dreads were personalized. Almost everybody felt that an unusual epidemic of misfortunes hinted at retribution. And while the more intelligent disclaimed any interest in such witcheries, even the best of them might be heard to remark—though pretending not to mean it—that Someone or Something must have laid a curse upon Arabia. For the following summer was the worst season that the oldest could remember, and in the fall there were but few caravans carrying hides and wool to the Port of Gaza. The young camels they would have brought to market in Petra, Jericho, and Joppa were too lean and shabby for profitable sale. There was very little surplus of grain to see the livestock through the approaching winter. The air was tense with complaint and constraint. Somebody was to blame. The trouble all seemed to stem from Arabia\'s alliance with the Jews. Everyone was able to recall now how he himself had predicted, at the time, that no good could come of it. Of course no one held it against Arnon, for clearly she had suffered from it far more than anybody. And it would be cruel foolishness to frown upon the hapless child who symbolized that unfortunate union. But—even so—the visits of Arnon\'s friends became less and less frequent. She did not fret about it at first, realizing that everyone was weighted with worries at home, and in no mood for sociability. Curiously enough, there was better pasture on Arnon\'s land than anywhere else for many miles. Her neighbours did not openly begrudge the Princess this bit of prosperity, but it did seem strange. One day a sheik remarked half-humorously that wherever you found a Jew located you might expect to see fat sheep. \'A Jew?\' queried the friend who rode beside him. \'What Jew?\' \'Had you not noticed Princess Arnon\'s pasture?\' \'The Princess is not a Jew!\' retorted his friend. \'No—but her child is.\' It was all but incredible, the speed with which this idle quip raced across the browned face of Arabia until it was repeated in the coldest tents of the hungry highlands. But there were a few whose unswerving loyalty to the Princess made them all the more eager to show her friendly attentions as this unfavourable sentiment developed. Zendi and Rennah rode over every few days to make sure of Arnon\'s welfare. Although she was now a Princess only by courtesy, Zendi endeavoured to keep her informed of movements in the kingdom, as if she still had a right to know. One day he talked of the unfortunate expedition to Jerusalem, and reported that Emperor Tiberius had decided not to appoint another Jew as a ruler of Judaea. Henceforth the chief executive would be a Roman. The new appointee was already located in Jerusalem. He had been elevated from the Prefecture of Crete. His name was Pontius Pilate. Doubtless he would get along with the Jews. He was said to be a tactful conciliator. \'Will this affect the position of Antipas—in Galilee?\' Arnon wanted to know. \'Probably not,\' surmised Zendi. \'The tribute Rome receives from poor little Galilee isn\'t worth what it costs to collect it. Antipas could afford to pay their taxes himself and doubtless would do so gladly enough, just to preserve the title of Tetrarch.\' Sometimes Zendi and Rennah gave Arnon an opportunity to speak of the growing aloofness toward her, but she appeared not to be aware of it, and the painful subject was not discussed. Frequently Mishma\'s pretty daughter-in-law Kitra came to spend the afternoon, bringing her four-year-old son Voldi, who had promptly taken a fancy to little Fara. The warm friendship of Kitra and Arnon, begun in childhood, had ripened to a comforting intimacy, nourished perhaps by the fact that Princess Arnon was no longer of the King\'s household, while Kitra had missed being in that position by the mere accident of a delayed appointment of her father-in-law Mishma as Chief of the Councillors and, as such, the immediate successor to Aretas. They spent long afternoons together, happily watching their children\'s absorption in one another, for Fara had had no other playmates and Voldi had never taken such an interest in another child. Sometimes the two young mothers would wonder whether this tender little friendship might continue as their children grew up, though they admitted that it wasn\'t customary. After three consecutive winters of such hardships as Arabia had never known, succeeded by scorched summers presaging further endurance of famine for both men and beasts, the snow fell in abundance. It fell endlessly and everywhere; on the mountains, in the valleys, covering great tracts of arid desert that had not seen any moisture for a score of years. It snowed and thawed and snowed again until the wadis were in flood. Spring came early, the sun was bright, all Arabia was a green pasture. Men who had become so deeply depressed over their losses that they had actually debated whether, for the country\'s sake, it might not be advisable to carry Princess Arnon\'s child back to Jerusalem \'where she belongs,\' were now glad that they had done no such thing, and some of them felt sheepish over having shared in these conversations. It was hardly to be expected that such good fortune could happen again, but it did. Not only during the next winter, but the winter following, heavy snows blanketed the entire nation; and in the succeeding autumns long, heavily laden caravans trekked down the mountains and rounded the southern shore of the Dead Sea, and slowly marched to the old \'salt trail\' from Engedi to Gaza. Not infrequently some gratified shepherd, with silver jingling in his pouch, would remark that the young daughter of Princess Arnon, far from being a menace to Arabia, was bringing Jewish prosperity to the nation, to which his neighbour would reply, \'I always said you were a lot of fools for hating that pretty child!\' \'But—you said yourself that she ought to be put out of the country!\' \'If I did, that doesn\'t make you any less a fool for saying so.\' Everybody who had seen little Fara agreed now that she was the most beautiful child in Arabia, which was unquestionably true. She had the full, wide-set eyes and round face of a Jewess, and a much fairer complexion than her attractive mother. Her slim, lithe body was distinctly Arabian, as was her interest in outdoor life. She had been lifted into a small saddle when she was barely five, the worshipful old Kedar walking alongside the pony. It was not long before she protested against such attendance. One morning when she was no more than six she appeared alone at the King\'s encampment, to the consternation of the household. Zendi himself rode home beside her to make sure she arrived safely. Arnon, quite complacent, met them at the door. \'You shouldn\'t let her do that,\' reproved Zendi. \'She isn\'t old enough.\' \'The pony is,\' said Arnon. \'He wouldn\'t let her get into trouble. He follows her about like a dog.\' \'But ponies are treacherous, Arnon. I should much sooner trust a horse.\' \'That is quite true, sire. I shall let her ride one of the horses.\' She had spoken half-playfully, but added, in a suddenly serious tone, \'Don\'t forget, Zendi, that my little daughter is every inch an Arabian! You were taught to ride almost as soon as you were able to walk—and so was I.\' This incident, trivial enough in itself, was reported to the Councillors, who received it—and its implications—with smiles and nods of approval. The child was unfortunately afflicted with alien blood, but it was clear that she was predominantly Arabian and deserved recognition as one of their own people. By the time the story was well circulated, losing nothing in its travels, little Fara was an accomplished rider, skilful and unafraid. And the rumour wasn\'t far from the truth. But if Arabia had an imaginary picture of this growing child as a reckless rowdy, leaping half-broken racehorses over high hedges and deep wadis with the firm hands and pliant knees of an experienced cavalryman, there was another side of Fara\'s life which nobody saw but her own family—and King Zendi. Thanks to Ione, Fara was receiving a liberal education. To all appearances, the beloved and indispensable Ione had fully adjusted herself to her Arabian environment, but it was a sorrow to her never to hear or speak a word of her native Greek. When little Fara was learning to talk, Ione amused herself by teaching her Greek words for familiar objects. When she handed the baby her porridge plate, she would say, \'Pinakos.\' And Fara, ever eager to please Ione, would lisp, \'Pinakos\'; and because Ione seemed so delighted, she proudly repeated the word, over and over. The little porridge plate was always \'pinakos\' after that, and the little cup was always \'poterion\' and the napkin was \'soudarion.\' Arnon too enjoyed the game. \'Teach her to say \\"I love you,\\" Ione.\' Taking the child on her lap, Ione said softly, \'Fara, I love you. Philo seh. Philo seh. I love you.\' \'Philo seh,\' repeated Fara dutifully, happily. \'Say that to your mother, Fara.\' Arnon reached out her arms and little Fara cuddled close to her. \'I love you,\' whispered Arnon. \'Philo seh,\' said Fara. As the days went by, the intrusion of Greek words into their conversation was no longer a novelty that made them laugh merrily. Common nouns needed action. Words multiplied into sentences. Table-talk was conducted in Greek. After supper, on winter evenings, Ione taught Fara to write it. Happy to see her child profitably entertained, Arnon joined in these exercises, though she never acquired the effortless fluency with which Fara handled the strange language. By the time she was nine the little girl spoke Greek by preference. One day, King Zendi called to inquire about their welfare and overheard Fara in the adjoining room talking to Ione. He broke off what he was saying—and listened—and then grinned incredulously. \'How long has this been going on?\' he inquired. \'Ever since she was a tiny tot,\' said Arnon. \'It\'s Ione\'s doing. I suppose there\'s no harm in it?\' \'Harm? Of course not! I wish I knew some Greek myself.\' \'But—you do; don\'t you, Zendi?\' \'A mere smattering—picked up on my journey to Corinth. I often have errands in Petra. It would be much to my advantage if I could speak their language.\' Arnon laughed a little as she said, \'Perhaps Fara could help you.\' To her surprise, Zendi did not see anything funny about this. He frowned thoughtfully. \'It just occurs to me,\' he said, \'that we have, in our cabinet of curiosities, a scroll that the people of Petra presented to your father at his coronation. I shall bring it over. Maybe Fara might like to see it.\' The next afternoon he brought the scroll. Ione was invited in to look at it. She gasped with happy surprise. What a treasure! Unconsciously ignoring the King, she breathlessly explained the subject of the scroll to Fara in a long sentence utterly incomprehensible to their important guest. And Fara clapped her hands with delight. \'I would give much for that knowledge,\' said Zendi soberly. \'It\'s easy, sire,\' said Fara. When he left, shortly afterward, Fara walked beside him in the paddock. He took her small hand. The old master of the stables led forward a beautiful roan gelding. Fara\'s eyes shone. \'How do you like my new horse, Fara?\' asked the King as he gathered up the reins. \'Prosphilay!\' murmured Fara reverentially, patting the gelding\'s glossy shoulder. \'Prosphilay hippos!\' \'What did you say?\' demanded the King. \'Lovely!\' said Fara. \'Lovely horse!\' Zendi chuckled and swung himself into the saddle. \'Kai megaleios hippikos!\' ventured Fara coyly. \'And what does that mean?\' the King wanted to know. Fara shrugged a pretty shoulder, gave an enigmatic smile, and made a graceful curtsey. Zendi waved a hand and rode away. It was evident that Fara\'s final remark—whatever it meant—was complimentary. After that the tribesmen were often amused to see their King cantering alongside Princess Arnon\'s pretty child, evidently engaged in serious conversation. One day, after a visit to Petra, Zendi presented his young preceptress with an armful of scrolls which he had bought. Ione, on her knees, laid them out in a row on the rug and caressed them with worshipful hands, murmuring, \'Thaumasia! Thaumasia!\' To have such a rich library—it was indeed wonderful! Marvellous! As for Fara\'s early knowledge of her origin, she had been contented with the explanation that her father was a Prince who had been required to leave them that he might perform his duties as the ruler of a faraway country. Now that she was asking for a little more information, Arnon would talk of the great cities in which she had lived with Fara\'s father, carefully avoiding any mention of her unhappiness. \'Will my father ever visit us?\' Fara had asked wistfully. \'He would find it difficult,\' Arnon had replied; and this was the exact truth. \'Great rulers,\' she went on, \'have many cares.\' \'But—does he not care—at all—for us?\' \'A ruler\'s life, my dear, is not his own. His only concern is for the welfare of his country.\' Arnon despised herself for what, in this case, was a ridiculous lie; but felt that it was an easy way out of a painful discussion. The time would come soon enough, she knew, when the whole matter would have to be faced; but she hoped to postpone it as long as possible. Fara was beginning to be aware of her loneliness and singularity. She was nearing ten and growing very restless. She needed companions of her own age. It had been a long time since Kitra had brought Voldi along when she came to visit. One day Fara ventured to inquire how he was. \'Oh—that boy!\' exclaimed Kitra, busying herself with her needlework. \'He thinks he is quite a man now. Growing so fast; tall as I am. You know how boys of that age are, Fara. They don\'t want to play with girls. All they think about is their horses—and hunting dogs—and archery—and fencing.\' Her eyes slid past Fara to Arnon. \'You may be glad Fara is a girl. I never have a peaceful moment when Voldi is riding that unruly horse of his!\' \'Fara rides too,\' said Arnon quietly. \'Yes—I know,\' said Kitra. \'And Fara rides very well indeed!\' Then the talk veered off to another topic and Fara strolled away to her own room. She languidly took up the little tapestry on which she had been investing oddments of unoccupied time. Ione joined her. They sat in silence for awhile, Ione exasperatingly tranquil, Fara recklessly stabbing her needle into the stiff fabric. \'Don\'t you ever feel penned in, Ione?\' The tapestry sailed across the room and landed on the bed. \'How does it feel to be a slave?\' Fara went on savagely, as if she meant to offend. \'If I were a slave, I\'d run away! Why don\'t you?\' \'Where would I run to?\' asked Ione, blinking back the tears, for Fara\'s rudeness had hurt. \'You could go home,\' gruffly. \'But—this is my home, dear; same as it is yours.\' \'Nonsense!\' muttered Fara. \'You can\'t be contented here any more than I can! This place stifles me! Sometimes I think I\'ll jump out of my skin!\' \'Your mother would be very sorry, Fara, if she heard you say such things,\' reproved Ione. \'Well, she won\'t,\' declared Fara. \'But\'—suddenly dejected—\'I had to say it to somebody. Please forgive me.\' \'Of course,\' murmured Ione, quick to understand. \'It\'s natural for children of your age to be restless. You\'re growing so fast that the encampment isn\'t big enough to hold you. You will get over that when you are older.\' Fara crossed the room, flung herself down on her bed, and lacing her fingers behind her head, stared at the blue ceiling. \'Wouldn\'t you like to see something besides sheep?\' she mumbled, mostly to herself. \'And go to some place where they talked about other things than the price of camels—and how are we going to find enough grass? Wouldn\'t you like to live in a great house—in a great city?\' \'No, dear,\' replied Ione, when some rejoinder seemed necessary. \'I have done that. I\'m quite satisfied to be here—where I am, in these beautiful mountains.\' \'Maybe I should be satisfied too,\' admitted Fara. \'I wish I was like other people. There\'s something wrong with me, Ione,\' she exclaimed impulsively. \'I\'m different! And I hate it!\' It was not until she was eleven that Fara learned how and why she was different. She came by accident upon the soul-sickening truth about her father\'s perfidy and her mother\'s incurable unhappiness and her own defenceless position as a half-breed. She had ridden with Arnon, that midsummer afternoon, to the King\'s encampment. Zendi was absent on a tour of the eastern tribes. Rennah and Arnon lounged in the Queen\'s suite while Fara and the spoiled young Prince Deran strolled about indifferently inspecting the kennels and stables. Tiring of this entertainment and agreeing that the sun was too hot, the children returned to the spacious living quarters, where Deran, eager to impress his guest, led the way into the huge, high-vaulted tent which was set apart for the exclusive use of the King and his Councillors. With a boyish swagger, Deran stalked about, explaining the various appointments. Having casually seated himself in the King\'s massive chair, he invited Fara to do the same. He wouldn\'t think, he said, of letting anyone else sit there. Fara smiled prettily to show her appreciation. Thus encouraged, Deran led her around the ancient table, declaiming what he knew about the symbolic carvings, and—in a hushed voice—called her attention to the impressive documents which lay waiting official action. Fara, who had come to have deep respect for ancient crafts and historical writings, gave full attention to the table and its important freight. \'You mustn\'t touch anything,\' cautioned Deran. Fara shook her head and continued to survey the awesome documents with fascination. Presently she came upon a slightly faded, multi-coloured sheet of papyrus which she read, with widening eyes and mounting comprehension. Deran, a little younger but much taller, stood at her shoulder, staring in bewilderment at her flushed cheek. She turned abruptly toward him, searching his face, but he gave no sign of knowing or caring what tiresome thing she had been reading. When they arrived home shortly before sunset, Fara followed Arnon into her bedroom, impulsively reported what she had seen in the King\'s tent, and entreated her mother to tell her everything, which she did. Everything!—the alliance, the marriage, the lonely days in Jerusalem, the humiliating days in Rome! All the pent-up wretchedness of Arnon\'s ruined life poured forth, accompanied by a flood of tears. When the sad, sordid story was finished, the unhappy Princess dried her eyes and was surprised to find that Fara, instead of sharing her mother\'s grief, was standing there dry-eyed, with her childish mouth firmed into a straight line and her brows contracted into an expression of bitter hatred. \'And why has no one hunted him down—and punished him?\' she demanded indignantly. \'It\'s much too late for that,\' said Arnon. \'When it happened our country was in great distress. No one could be spared. And now that we have such great prosperity, no one remembers.\' She sighed deeply, and went on, \'Perhaps it is just as well. Galilee is a long way off. The Prince is well protected. Let us try to forget all about it, dear.\' Fara shook her head slowly. \'I shall remember—always!\' she muttered. That winter was long and severe. Arnon fell ill with a fever and relentless fits of coughing. Fara through these anxious days had no other concern but for her mother. Ione tried unsuccessfully to renew her interest in the classics, in her modelling, in her drawing. \'Do persuade the unhappy child to get out and take some exercise!\' begged Arnon. \'She is so unlike herself, Ione.\' \'It worries me too, Princess Arnon. Something has come over her.\' \'She is fretting because I am ill,\' said Arnon. \'Of course, Princess Arnon,\' agreed Ione obligingly, \'but you will be better when spring comes again.\' And spring did come again, and Arnon improved enough to be able to sit in the sunshine and walk in the garden, but Fara\'s depression was unrelieved. All her natural gaiety was gone. One afternoon when Rennah came to call, she found Arnon and Fara together in the garden. Almost immediately, Fara excused herself and strolled away. Rennah followed her with troubled eyes. \'She is growing taller; but, Arnon, Fara does not look well. Is something worrying her?\' \'Fara has been fretting all winter about me,\' said Arnon. \'She is a most dutiful child.\' \'But now that you are getting well—\' \'I have thought of that, Rennah. She should be happy again. I wish we could think of something that might divert her. She has no interest in anything.\' \'She will have a birthday soon,\' remembered Rennah. \'How about having a party?\' Her face lighted. \'Would you let me have a party for Fara? I know Zendi would be glad. We will make quite a day of it—with the Councillors and their wives and all the children and grandchildren—and races and games and plenty to eat.\' \'It is like you, dear Rennah, to want to do such a kindness,\' said Arnon. \'I hope you will not go to too much trouble.\' \'Zendi will approve, I know,\' said Rennah. \'It\'s high time we gave that sweet child some attention. We have neglected her too long. It should mean something to the people that Fara\'s grandfathers were Kings!\' So, on the fifteenth of Adar, which turned out to be the fairest day of that early summer, the King and Queen celebrated Fara\'s twelfth anniversary with a party that greatly exceeded Rennah\'s original plan, not only in the entertainment provided but in the number of guests; for, having decided to do it, Zendi included all the sheiks and tribal leaders with their families. Fara had been dismayed upon learning of the project in her honour and so seriously objected that she was all but in open revolt, until Zendi himself explained that as a child of royal blood she was not only entitled to certain favours but was expected to receive them graciously. And when Fara continued to frown disapprovingly, Zendi\'s patience gave out and he informed her that whether she wanted it or not there was going to be a birthday party for her at the King\'s encampment on the fifteenth day of Adar; and that, whether she wanted to or not, she was going to be there, bright and early! Late in the night, after the party was over and everyone had gone home, Zendi told Rennah what he had said, so impatiently, to Fara when she had begged him not to celebrate her birthday. \'If I had had the slightest idea of what was troubling the child,\' he confided, \'I should have yielded to her wishes. As it stands now our celebration of her birthday has been of no advantage to her. Indeed, it has done her harm. Everyone will think she is queer, if not definitely out of her mind.\' The almost incredible thing that happened was reserved for the banquet in the evening, attended only by the royal household, the Councillors and their wives, and a few distinguished guests from Petra, where Zendi was becoming favourably known. Nothing unusual had marked the happy events of the day. There had been exciting contests of strength and skill; acrobatic performances, wrestling, fencing, foot races. Magicians had done baffling tricks. Minstrels had sung. There were horseraces that would have done credit to the famed elliptical track in Rome\'s mighty Colosseum. And there were equestrian exhibitions staged by various groups of reckless young Arabs, some of the contestants hardly more than children. As was to be expected, there were a few bad spills, some broken bones and ruined horses. The final event was a breath-taking hurdle race ridden by youths in their middle teens. The hurdles were high and the race was dangerous. Of the twelve horses that started, three finished. Obliged by the circumstances to sit with the dignitaries in the royal stand, Fara turned to her mother as the perspiring young victor rode up to salute the King, and whispered, \'Who is that boy?\' Before Arnon could reply, Kitra, seated immediately behind them, leaned forward to say, with a proud but nervous little laugh, \'Why—don\'t you remember him, Fara? That\'s Voldi! You used to play together.\' Fara turned to her with a smile and a nod of remembrance. \'He is a wonderful rider,\' she murmured, in the husky-timbred tone that her voice had acquired. Queen Rennah, overhearing, said, \'We will ask him to come up, Fara, and renew acquaintance.\' Fara bit her lip and flushed a little. Meeting Arnon\'s eyes, she frowned and shook her head almost imperceptibly. Arnon smiled, pursed her lips, and nodded, as if to say, \'We mustn\'t object to that: it\'s quite the thing to do.\' Presently Voldi, dismounting, came up into the royal enclosure, bowed deeply to the King and Queen, and made his way toward his mother. They gave him a seat beside Fara. She searched his brown, freckled face with wide, sober eyes. Then her full lips parted in a smile of candid admiration. He coloured a little through the tan, under this frank inspection, and slowly met her smile with the bewildered expression of one who has just come upon a valuable discovery. Rennah, keenly observant, turned her head toward Kitra and whispered, \'Isn\'t that sweet?\' Kitra nodded and smiled briefly, but there was a trace of anxiety in her eyes. Rennah caught it, and thought she understood. \'You grew up, didn\'t you?\' murmured Fara, in her peculiarly low-pitched voice that made everything she said sound confidential. \'So did you,\' stammered Voldi. \'I shouldn\'t have known you.\' \'That was really great riding, Voldi!\' said Fara fervently. \'You ride too, don\'t you?\' \'Not like that.\' \'Want to take a ride with me, some day?\' \'If you think it wouldn\'t be tiresome—to ride very carefully.\' Their mothers and the Queen, shamelessly eavesdropping, laughed at Voldi\'s expense, but he was too fascinated to notice their amusement. \'Tomorrow afternoon?\' he asked. Fara nodded slowly, smiled a little; then suddenly retreated from the enraptured eyes. \'You promised to spend the day with your grandfather, Voldi,\' put in Kitra. \'I\'ll tell him.\' Voldi rose to go. \'Tomorrow afternoon, Fara.\' They all—except Fara—followed the tall boy with their eyes and saw him pause to say something to his grandfather who soberly made a show of concealing his pride in the youngster\'s obvious affection for him. \'Happy days for good old Mishma,\' remarked the Queen. \'Yes,\' said Kitra absently. Noting the remote tone of Kitra\'s uninterested response, Arnon involuntarily turned her head to seek a reason for it, but Kitra did not meet her inquiring eyes. The little by-play was quite lost on Fara, whose attention pursued Voldi as he strode down the steps and mounted his tired horse. In the evening oxen were roasted over deep pits of glowing coals, and everybody feasted in the open but the royal hosts and their important guests. Fara was the only young person present at the King\'s banquet. There had been some debate whether to invite a few of the younger ones of Fara\'s age, but it was difficult to discriminate among them and the room would not accommodate them all. After the elaborate dinner was served, brief speeches were made in honour of Fara, whom they all addressed as \'Princess\'. No one of the eulogistic Councillors made any reference to the royal blood contributed by Judaea, but memories were refreshed concerning the wisdom and courage of Grandsire Aretas, who was already well on the way to an exalted rating among Arabia\'s legendary heroes. Throughout the ordeal—for it was nothing less than that—Fara sat between her mother and King Zendi, attentive and sober-faced, as became a young girl unused to so much adult acclaim. She seemed to be listening to everything that was said, though close observers noticed that her expression remained unchanged when Chief Councillor Mishma was reminded of an amusing incident and everyone else laughed. Apparently Fara had not heard it. It was evident that she had something on her mind. When the speeches of felicitation were ended and nothing remained to be said except a word of adjournment, Zendi turned with a paternal smile toward his young guest of honour. \'Now, Princess Fara,\' he said kindly, \'it is your turn. You may make a bow—or make a speech—or sing a song.\' They all applauded the King\'s half-playful suggestion, but stopped suddenly when Fara rose to her feet. Arnon, seated beside her, glanced up apprehensively as if to inquire, \'What is my child planning to do?\' Fara did not smile or speak. Slowly leaving her place she walked with determined steps to the massive table. The audience leaned forward and held its breath, wondering what was about to happen. Moving around the table until she faced the King, Fara made a deep bow. Then, to the amazement of everyone, she whipped a little dagger from her belt and deftly drew a red streak diagonally across her left forearm. Bending over the long neglected, unsigned vow of vengeance, she took up the stylus, dipped it in her blood, and wrote FARA. For a moment they all sat stunned to silence. Then Rennah rose and hurried to Fara\'s side. Arnon, much shaken, quickly joined the Queen and together they led the bleeding Princess out to attend to her wound. Fara\'s face was pale but her eyes were bright and a proud little smile trembled on her lips. Zendi rose, instantly claiming the full attention of his silent, bewildered guests. \'Some brave young blood has been shed here tonight,\' he said solemnly. \'You may be assured that Arabia will not permit this gallant child ever to risk her life in an attempt to keep her vow; but her courageous act, done in all sincerity, is proudly appreciated by her country.\' \'Aye!\' mumbled old Mishma. \'Aye! Aye!\' responded many voices. There was a long moment of silence before Zendi signified with a gesture that they were now free to disperse. The people stirred, uneasily questing one another\'s baffled eyes. Mishma, standing at the King\'s elbow, suggested that the unprecedented event should be kept a secret. \'That would be most desirable, Mishma, if we could,\' agreed Zendi. \'But it cannot be done. It is possible to pledge three people—or five—to keep a secret; but not fifty. Perhaps it is better to let them all talk until they have tired of it—and then it will be forgotten. After all, she is only a child.\' And so it was told throughout the whole Kingdom of Arabia that Princess Arnon\'s young daughter had vowed to assassinate her Jewish father. The first reaction was that of sheer admiration mixed with amiable amusement. The little girl had shown great courage. She might be part Jew, but she was all Arab! Of course her vow—considered practically—was ridiculous. When she grew a little older, her recollection of it would be embarrassing, no doubt. And after a few weeks of free discussion, the strange incident—as Zendi had predicted—was forgotten. Young Voldi, completely infatuated and not caring who knew it, spent more and more time at Arnon\'s encampment, to the mounting anxiety of his parents, for he was a popular, well-favoured youth, giving promise of a bright future. With his exceptional talents for making friends and the reputation he had already won as a fearless sportsman, it was not too much to hope that his country might some day confer honours upon him. He might easily win an appointment to the King\'s Council. But it seemed doubtful to Urson and Kitra that their idolized son could fulfil these high expectations if embarrassed by an alliance with a young woman of alien blood, especially Jewish blood. Whatever might be her beauty, courage, and charm, Fara would be a heavy liability. Nor was Voldi insensitive to his parents\' uneasiness. He was deeply devoted to them and their anxiety distressed him. There were no stormy scenes. Perhaps it might have been easier for him to ignore their wishes if they had angered him with stern admonitions—if Urson had lashed out at him with bitter scorn or if his mother had become noisily hysterical. The unhappy situation was hardly mentioned among them, but it was ever present in their thoughts. Urson seldom laughed now. And when Voldi, setting forth in the morning to spend the day with the adorable young daughter of Antipas the scoundrel, turned in his saddle to wave a hand to Kitra, standing before the doorway, trying to smile through her welling tears, he felt like an ingrate. And he had other misgivings. He was seeing very little of his companions. Until recently he had spent most of his time with his hard-riding young cronies. Indeed, he had been the acknowledged leader of this adventurous crew. What were they thinking about him? What were they saying about him, as they sat around their evening camp-fire in the mountains after a long day\'s chase for wild game? It would be a sore affliction if his friends were to chatter contemptuously of his demoralizing love-sickness. He resolved to free himself of this dread. One morning, having had word of their plans for a three-day stag-hunt, Voldi arrived early at the accustomed rendezvous, fully equipped for the excursion. There was a bit of embarrassment at first, but the constraint quickly lifted. Voldi was one of them again. Intent upon restoring himself to their good opinion, he led them for hours in the maddest ride they had ever taken—leaping deep gulleys cut by mountain streams, hurdling fallen timber, plunging through tangled underbrush. Challenged by his recklessness, they did their utmost to follow. Young Museph, the elder son of Councillor Tema, kept hard on his leader\'s heels and brought down the largest stag of the three killed that day. Voldi accounted for the others. Most of the party were out-distanced and came straggling into camp in the late afternoon, weary beyond any words to tell of it. A camp-fire was built beside a noisy mountain stream. The stags were hung up and dressed. Museph flung himself down on the aromatic pine-needles that carpeted the ground; and when Voldi sat down beside him, regarding him with a teasing grin, Museph opened one eye and muttered, \'My brother, you have lost your mind.\' The last to arrive in camp was young Prince Deran, King Zendi\'s arrogant son, attended by four members of the hunt who had reluctantly tarried with him when the pace had grown too hot. The Prince had bagged a little doe. No one ventured to rebuke him, but the general silence expressed the party\'s opinion. Deran was quite aware of his companions\' disfavour, aware too that had he been anyone else than the heir to the throne he would have been appropriately chastised. He cared nothing for their unspoken disapproval. His manner said that if the King\'s son wished to kill a baby doe, who had a right to oppose him? After supper there were some acrobatics, a wrestling match, and a fencing bout with wooden broadswords. It was proposed that they have a duel with daggers. \'How about you and Museph, Voldi?\' a voice inquired. \'I\'m too tired,\' said Museph. \'Besides, I\'m no match for Voldi.\' \'We will take him on!\' shouted the Prince, getting to his feet. All eyes—and they were sullen eyes—turned in his direction. They covertly scorned the pompous youngster, hated his poor sportsmanship, loathed his insolent \'we\'. \'It wouldn\'t be fair, Prince,\' said Voldi, trying to make his tone sound respectful. \'I am older than you—and I have had more practice.\' \'But not lately,\' sneered Deran; \'or do you play with daggers when you visit your Jewish friend?\' All breathing around the camp fire was suspended. Voldi flushed and frowned. \'I do not wish to fence with you, Prince Deran,\' he said. \'As we thought!\' crowed Deran. \'That\'s what comes of consorting with soft aliens.\' He took a step forward and drew his dagger. \'Stand up and fight, fellow!\' Voldi slowly rose, and observed, as had several of the others, that the blade of Deran\'s dagger flashed brightly in the firelight. \'You\'re not intending to fight me with steel, I hope!\' he said sharply. A concerted murmur of disapproval instantly backed him up. It was a shameful abuse of royal privilege. Every youth in the party knew the Prince was not vulnerable to any injury. It would be worth any man\'s liberty, if not his life, to hurt this boy. Bewildered by his predicament Voldi stood with his thumbs under his belt, making no move to defend himself. Young Deran, crouching, advanced with short steps. \'You\'d better draw, Voldi,\' he growled, \'or admit you\'re a coward.\' Apparently it was the wrong word even for the King\'s son to use. Voldi lunged forward, drove his right elbow into the Prince\'s midriff, clutched the wildly flailing forearm in a vice-like grip, twisted the dagger out of Deran\'s hand, and tossed it into the fire. Panting with rage, the Prince again hurled himself at Voldi who, disregarding the impotent fists, slapped the youngster full in the face. \'You\'ll pay for that!\' squeaked Deran. Gentle if disgusted hands led the infuriated Prince to his tent for repairs to his royal pride and bleeding lips. Voldi resumed a seat on the ground, a little way apart from the others, and sat with bent head and slumped shoulders. \'I\'m sorry,\' he mumbled dejectedly, shaking his head. It was a critical moment for all of them. No one cared to risk being quoted as having said, \'Good work, Voldi! Just what he deserved! What else could you have done?\' At length Museph scrambled to his feet, threw another pine stick on the fire, dusted his hands; and, sauntering over to Voldi, companionably sat down beside him. Young Raboth, the lean, hawk-nosed nephew of Councillor Dumah, crossed from the other side of the silent circle, made a big business of poking the fire; and, as he passed Voldi, gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder. The rest of them breathed more freely and exchanged grins. Deran did not reappear that night, and left for home early the next morning. Voldi made no mention of the unpleasant affair at home, but for many days he waited, in considerable trepidation, a summons to present himself at the King\'s encampment; for it seemed almost certain that Deran would have made a bad report of the incident. But apparently the episode was to be overlooked. Either the Prince had decided to hold his tongue or the King, having heard his son\'s story, had drawn his own conclusions and had thought it prudent to let the matter drop. But the true story unquestionably had got to the ears of the Council; for a week later, Voldi was invited to spend the day with his revered Grandfather Mishma. He went with anxiety pounding in his heart, for he was devoted to the old man and would be grieved at his displeasure. But it turned out to be a happy visit. Nothing was said about the unfortunate incident in the woods. When Voldi left for home, Mishma followed him out to the paddock and ceremoniously presented him with a beautiful, high-spirited, black gelding. With one arm on the superb young animal\'s neck and the other hugging his grandfather, Voldi shouted his delight. The eminent Councillor stroked his white beard complacently and a twinkle shone in his eye. \'This frisky colt\'s name,\' he said, \'is Darik—after King Darik of old.\' \'He was called \\"Darik the Just,\\" was he not, sire?\' asked Voldi. \'Right! Because he was always fair in his judgments,\' said Mishma. \'It is told of him that King Darik was of a quick temper and knew better than most men how to handle a blade; but he never drew his sword against a weaker adversary—no matter what the provocation.\' The old man laid his thin hand on the gelding\'s velvet muzzle. \'This horse,\' he reflected, \'will require some managing, but he is of good character. See to it, my son, that he behaves himself.\' Voldi\'s visits to Fara continued. They rode together almost every day throughout the summer, and when the early winter came, with blustery weather driving them indoors, Arnon, observing their restlessness and lack of occupation, proposed that Voldi join them in their lately neglected studies. He consented to it with well-simulated interest. He had no particular ambition to learn, but any pastime was agreeable that would give him an excuse for hovering close to Fara. Ione was delighted with his progress. He had an aptitude for Greek, she declared; he had a feel for it; would soon be speaking it like a native! This was an exaggeration, but it encouraged Voldi to do his best. Moreover, he was able to tell his mother that the long winter afternoons in Princess Arnon\'s home were profitably spent. Kitra would smile indulgently—but it was plain to see that she was troubled. And Fara too was troubled about Voldi\'s adoration, her intuition— and the widening intervals between Kitra\'s visits—informing her that he was getting into trouble at home because of her. Once she almost decided to tell Voldi frankly that he mustn\'t come to see her any more, but her courage failed, for she loved him devotedly. Sometime—no matter how severely it hurt—he must be told; but Fara postponed the day of their sorrow. As the seasons came and went, Fara took on a maturity beyond her years. The circumstances of her life had made her thoughtful even as a child; now, with her sixteenth birthday in sight, she had the mind of an adult. The conviction had grown within her that she was fated to be a person unwanted; viewed with suspicion, an alien. The Jews would spurn her for being an Arabian; the Arabians would ignore her for being a Jew. What ailed the world that grown men and women should treat one another so? Once she had put the question to Ione, who had replied, with a sigh, \'It was always that way, my dear, from the beginning.\' \'It\'s a lonely world—for some people,\' said Fara. \'I know how you feel,\' sympathized Ione. \'I have been lonely too.\' \'Yes, but you have a nationality, Ione! You are far away from your own country; but you do have a country. It isn\'t as if you were a mixture of two countries that hated each other. Me—I am nobody!\' \'Do not be depressed, Fara,\' entreated Ione. \'There are many who love you, who will always love you. No girl in the world ever had such a devoted lover as Voldi.\' \'I know,\' murmured Fara, \'but—he shouldn\'t!\' Her voice trembled. \'I mustn\'t let him! He can\'t marry me! It would ruin him! Ione—what am I going to do?\' Shortly before sunset the Princess Arnon, long ailing of infirmities associated with a broken heart, slipped away so quietly that for some little time they weren\'t quite sure. It was Fara who first realized that it was all over. Since noon she had been crouching beside the bed with her forehead pressed against her mother\'s thin arm, now raising up tearfully to peer into the unresponsive face, then dejectedly slumping down again to wait. At mid-afternoon old Kedar noisily rolled up the leather panels on the northern and eastern exposures of the octagonal tent, just as he would have done at this hour on any other fair summer day. Kedar had seen plenty of death in his four-score years and it no longer upset him. Indeed, he was almost too casual in its presence today, strutting his old bones about with something of a proprietorial swagger as if he and death had a private understanding. All day long the female servants, a dozen or more, had tiptoed in by twos and threes to stand helplessly at a respectful distance from the bed, regarding their dying mistress with compassionate eyes, and had tiptoed out again as if remembering some neglected duty. Nothing remained to be done for Arnon; or, if so, there was old Nephti who had nursed both Princesses from babyhood, and the faithful Ione, hovering close—and a bit jealous of each other. The whole mind of the household at present was concentrated on Fara and her probable plans for the future. Of course she would now marry Voldi, whose constant attentions during the past few years had been unceasing and whose intentions were unmistakable. It was generally taken for granted that Fara had decided not to marry until her responsibility to her mother had ended. And that responsibility had increased as Arnon\'s strength declined; for the unhappy Princess had developed an immense capacity for absorbing all manner of trivial but incessant personal services. \'Hand me the small pillow, please. No—the other one, dear, the blue one. Thanks, Fara, but I believe I\'d rather have my shawl. It\'s out in the pergola, I think. Would you mind getting it, darling? I know I\'m a dreadful bother.\' And so she was; but it had never seemed to annoy Fara, who stayed on duty day and night. Obviously she couldn\'t bring much happiness to Voldi until she was free. It wouldn\'t be long now. But where would they live? This was the question that troubled the servants; especially the older ones. Arnon\'s land had been ceded to her only for her lifetime. It was inconceivable that Voldi, as Fara\'s husband, would press a claim to it, or that the King could consent to such favouritism. Voldi would be as nomadic as all others of equal rating. The fact that his father Urson was the son of Mishma, who as Chief of the Councillors was the heir-apparent to the throne, was of no immediate consequence. Arnon\'s land would revert to the King\'s domain. Voldi and Fara would follow the snow and the pasture. And the older servants, long accustomed to soft living, might be considered too frail for such a rigorous life. Indeed, as they huddled in little groups, waiting, watching, they wondered whether Fara herself was likely to be happy as a nomad. She had never taken any interest in their herds and flocks. She had shown much friendly concern for the shepherds and their families, but cared nothing for the business that provided her own living. Of course, there was no use trying to understand Fara. They had never known what to make of this alien who had become more of an enigma as she matured. She was as mysterious as she was beautiful. Doubtless that could be explained by her racial heritages. It was an odd combination—Arab and Jew. True, it was an arrestingly lovely blend, viewed objectively. Arabian women were taller than Jewesses and more sinewy. At sixteen, Fara\'s figure was slim, supple, almost boyish: in short, Arabian. Her face was an interesting study in racial conflict. The old antipathy was written there as on a map. The high, finely sculptured nose, with the slightly flaring, mobile, haughty nostrils, had been Arnon\'s gift. The childishly rounded chin and throat were Mariamne\'s. It was a readily responsive face, well disciplined in repose, but of swift reactions to any stirring event. She was capable of flashing Arabian rages like sudden summer storms in the mountains, but it was well worth anyone\'s patience and forbearance to wait for the penitent smile Fara had inherited from long generations of highly emotional people who believed in atonements and were never ashamed of their tears. Arnon\'s last day wore on, and when the declining sun had been nicked by the glowing tip of Arcturus, twenty miles away, old Kedar rolled up the western tent-panels also, admitting a jasmine-scented breeze. Rousing, Fara lifted her eyes to the breath-taking panorama of rolling hills in the foreground descending to the green Valley of Aisne, with the majestic Arcturus in the far distance; and, beyond the southern slope of the mountain, the dazzling white shoreline of the Dead Sea. Noting that Fara had been momentarily diverted from her vigil, Ione drew closer to whisper that Voldi had come. Did she want to see him? Fara shook her head. \'Tell Voldi not to wait,\' she murmured; and, as Ione moved away, she added, \'Tell him I cannot come now. He will understand.\' Fara\'s heavy eyes slowly returned to her mother\'s drawn face. She laid her cheek against Arnon\'s breast and listened—and listened. Old Nephti took a step forward and held up an outspread hand for silence, though no place had ever been so quiet. At length Fara straightened and kissed her mother on the forehead, very gently, so as not to waken her. Then she came slowly to her feet. Her eyes were tearless now and her proud face was composed. Lightly touching old Nephti\'s shoulder in a brief caress and making a weary little gesture of appreciation toward the others, she left the tent. Voldi was waiting in the garden. Rising, he held out his arms and Fara nestled her head against his breast. He could feel the silent, convulsive sobs and drew her closer. \'She is gone?\' he asked. Fara nodded wearily, dejectedly. \'I will take care of you, dear,\' murmured Voldi. \'Let us not speak of that now,\' said Fara, gently releasing herself from his embrace. \'There are many things to do, I suppose. Will you ride over to the King\'s encampment—and tell them?\' \'Of course; and then may I come back?\' \'Voldi, I am so very tired. Perhaps tomorrow...\' He took her in his arms again and kissed her, but her response was apathetic. After Voldi had ridden away, Ione joined Fara, who had remained in the garden, seated in her mother\'s favourite chair. \'What do we do now, Ione?\' she asked weakly. \'I know so little about it.\' \'The men will come tonight, dear, and attend to the burial.\' \'And—am I to have anything to do with that?\' \'No—you will not be expected to go along. Nephti and I will dress her for the burial.\' Ione reached out her hand. \'Come now—and take some rest. You are quite exhausted. I shall bring you something nourishing to drink.\' Late in the evening, King Zendi himself arrived, accompanied by a dozen neighbours. After a consoling word with Fara, he left her, saying that he and the Queen would see her tomorrow. Fara lay on her bed, with eyes closed and a pillow pressed hard over her head so that she might not hear the sounds of retiring hoofbeats. When she roused, everything was quiet. The full moon shone brightly through the tent-door. Ione slipped in very quietly. Fara sat up, patted the bed, and Ione obediently sat down beside her. \'I want you to do something for me, Ione,\' said Fara, hardly above a whisper, \'and I want you to promise me you will never, never tell.\' Ione\'s voice trembled a little as she promptly consented. Fara faced her with sober eyes. \'I want you to hold up your hand, Ione, and swear by your gods that you will do for me what I ask of you—and never reveal it to anyone!\' Ione hesitated and began to cry. \'I wish I knew, dear,\' she said, brokenly. \'I hope this isn\'t something you shouldn\'t do!\' \'Let me be the judge of that!\' Fara\'s tone was severe. \'Will you do as I say—and keep my secret?\' Ione protestingly put up a trembling hand and said, \'Yes, Fara—I will do as you wish—and never tell.\' Rising impetuously, Fara went to a small table where she kept her needlework, returning with a pair of scissors which she handed to the bewildered slave. \'You are to cut off my hair!\' Fara wound her fingers about her heavy braid, at the back of her neck. \'There! See, Ione? Just above my hand. I am to be a boy. Cut it like Voldi\'s.\' Ione was whimpering like a child. \'You promised!\' Fara shook her roughly by the shoulder. \'Don\'t sit there crying! Do as I say—and do it quickly!\' Still gasping incoherent protests, Ione committed the crime. When it was accomplished, Fara retired to the alcove and presently returned to exhibit herself in the conventional garb of a well-to-do young Arabian, the burnous patterned after Voldi\'s best. \'How do I look?\' she demanded. \'Where did you get it?\' asked Ione in a strained voice. \'Made it,\' said Fara, \'a long time ago.\' \'But why? What are you going to do?\' \'I am going very far away, Ione, to keep a vow,\' declared Fara. \'Now—see to it that you keep yours!\' The alarming news broke early in the morning. Old Kedar rode to the King\'s encampment with the appalling report that Fara had disappeared during the night. The fractious bay filly that she had insisted on stabling in a separate paddock was gone. Zendi sent word to a score of young cavalrymen, informing them of what had happened. In his opinion, Fara, beside herself with grief and unable to sleep, had gone for a reckless ride in the moonlight. Perhaps she had met with an accident. They set off in all directions. Voldi dashed away at a gallop along their favourite bridle-path skirting the rim of the plateau. At places where the trail was narrow and the descent precipitous, he dismounted and led his tired horse slowly, searching for ominous signs. When the late afternoon came, his hopes were fading. He was no longer meeting anxious friends engaged in the quest, for he was many miles beyond the furthest point he had ever travelled. Slowly he retraced his course as the twilight settled down. At intervals, where the path was dangerous, he stopped and listened into the deep silence, and despairingly called, \'Fara! Fara!\' Saidi, the bay filly, was independent and impertinent but sure-footed. Old Kedar, increasingly prudent at eighty, distrusted her; but Fara, better understanding the filly\'s caprices, knew that while Saidi was mischievous she was not malicious. For the first five miles of a gradual descent, Fara did not spare her. Time was precious. At any moment old Nephti, though strongly admonished to take her rest, might come in and find the bed empty. Immediately the household would be roused and a search would begin forthwith. At first Saidi—in need of exercise—wanted to play, changing her gait without warning from canter to lope and pretending to be frightened at every huge white boulder and pale grey clump of sage standing in the bright moonlight, but Fara\'s spurs soon dissuaded her from the belief that this was a romp. After a while the grade levelled off for a few miles before taking the sharp zigzags toward the valley floor. Here Fara dismounted and led Saidi until she began to toss her head impatiently, for she always objected to being led unless quite exhausted. Occasionally they passed a weaver\'s hut: no lights visible, everyone asleep except the little huddle of goats that stirred and lifted a few heads inquisitively. The night was still. Fara thought it strange that she was not lonely. Even her bereavement, not yet of seven hours\' duration, seemed to have occurred long ago; as indeed it had, for that incurable sorrow had set in when Arnon\'s waning strength presaged the inevitable end. It was strange too, thought Fara, that she felt no apprehensions about the grim and hazardous mission on which she had set forth. She made the experiment of saying to herself that this was a very serious business, a man\'s business, that undoubtedly would cause her much trouble long before she reached her well-fortified objective in Galilee; in short, that she was riding toward almost certain disaster as fast as Saidi\'s slim legs could carry her. But this re-examination of her purpose did nothing to discompose her, doubtless because she had so long and earnestly planned this audacious undertaking that it had become the sole aim of her life. And there was dear Voldi. What a deal of anxiety she had caused him! How much more kind it would have been, reflected Fara, if she had told him firmly that she could never marry him; and, if pressed for the reason, she could have said that she did not love him. But Voldi would have known it wasn\'t true, for she had given him too many guarantees of her affection. However—Voldi would not fret very long. A girl might in similar circumstances, but a man would quickly forget. How fortunate men were in their ability to pull their love up by the roots and transplant it so successfully that it grew again without the loss of a leaf or a petal. There was really no need for her to worry about Voldi. Only one anxiety disturbed her: what success would she have in masquerading as a young man? Of course there was no other alternative. It was quite inconceivable that a sixteen-year-old girl could travel alone from southern Arabia to northern Galilee without risking some very unpleasant, if not positively dangerous, experiences; but this effort to pose as a young man would be a very risky business. A few facts were in Fara\'s favour. Her natural speaking voice was low-pitched and throaty; it might easily be mistaken by a stranger for the voice of a boy in his mid-teens. Too, the loose-fitting burnous ignored the curves of her girlish figure. But, even so, it would require much courage and self-confidence to maintain her role if suddenly projected into the company of men. It had not yet occurred to her that it would be quite as difficult to deceive another woman. This dilemma had cost Fara many an anxious hour. She had privately practised being a bold and bumptious youth, accustomed to rough talk and capable of serving a large helping of convincing profanity. She had stalked up and down her bed-chamber with long, stiff-legged strides, jerking her head arrogantly from side to side as she scowled crossly into her mirrors, and growling gutturally. Once the absurdity of it had momentarily overcome her, and she had laughed at her reflection in the highly polished metal plate that hung by her door; but had instantly sobered at the sight of a pair of girlish dimples in this young man\'s cheeks, and resolved that she would do no more smiling. At the first signs of dawn Fara crossed the southern extremity of the fertile Valley of Aisne and moved on into the arid Valley of Zered, which skirted the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. It was a desolate expanse of parched and blistered land, utterly without vegetation, birds, rodents, or reptiles. There were even no insects, with which most deserts abound. The Dead Sea had been aptly named. Saidi clearly shared her rider\'s hope that they might soon be out of this forsaken country, and quickened her pace, Fara straining her eyes for a glimpse of the ancient village of Akra, which, she knew, maintained a precarious existence on a bit of oasis at the southernmost tip of the Dead Sea. The sun was already hot when she sighted it, a clump of palms and cypress, a straggling group of shabby cottages surrounding a large brown tent. This would be the khan where travellers and their pack-trains were accommodated. At the door of the tent, Fara dismounted from the perspiring filly, handed the reins to a taciturn old Arabian, and with long steps and an experimental swagger followed along to the corral, where she gruffly gave instructions how her mount was to be rubbed down and properly watered. And when the testy hostler growled that he knew how to take care of a horse, Fara shouted untruthfully that if he did he was the first old man she had ever seen who knew or cared whether a hot horse was safely watered, and that she proposed to stand by him until he had done it. A wizened old woman glumly prepared a bad breakfast of stale eggs and staler bread. Feeling that she had need of practice in maleness in the presence of women, Fara complained bitterly about the food and reviled the old woman in what she felt might be the customary terms for a man to use on such occasions. Then she demanded a bed, and denounced the old woman as a foul and dirty slattern when she saw the untidy cubicle provided for her. This execration she attempted in Greek, aware that her vocabulary of vituperation in that language—learned of the gentle Ione—would need some polishing. After two hours of deep sleep Fara was on her way again, after paying her hosts twice what they asked and swearing manfully that the place wasn\'t fit for a goat to live in; to which contemptuous accusation the old man and his slovenly wife—grateful for their unexpected windfall—respectfully agreed. Fara smiled complacently as Saidi bounded away over the north-bound trail, her fears about her ability to be a man having been somewhat alleviated. Late afternoon, after a sultry, monotonous ride along the blinding white seashore, she entered the town of Engedi, eastern terminus of the old salt trail from the Port of Gaza. It was an incredibly ugly place, its small, box-shaped houses built of sun-baked brick, suffocating a narrow, dusty street. At the principal inn, a little further on, the stableyard of which was crowded with camels, donkeys, and their grimy attendants, Fara asked courteously for food and a bed for the night. Instantly she realized that she had made a mistake when the surly proprietor showed her a filthy pallet in a room containing half a dozen similar cots. Backing disgustedly out of the room, she opened her accumulated treasures of Arabian profanity and made it known to the master of the inn that she wasn\'t in the habit of sleeping in rabbit-hutches, dog-kennels, or pigsties. Thus advised, the innkeeper deferentially led the way to a private room where the bed, if not comfortable, was less dirty than the one she had rejected. Fara gave this incident much earnest thought. It was obviously a mistake to ask for anything politely. The public considered politeness a sign of weakness. It had a very low opinion of gentle speech. To wait patiently and take your turn or to accept unprotestingly whatever was offered you meant only that you were accustomed to being pushed aside; that you knew you could not defend your rights. It was a thoroughly abominable world, decided Fara; but if it was that kind of world she would try to meet it on its own terms. Contracting her brows into a sullen frown and puffing her lips arrogantly, she marched heavily up and down the bare, creaking floor. In this belligerent mood she returned, with long steps, to the common room and flung herself into a dilapidated chair. Crossing her legs she sat impatiently flicking her high- laced boot with a finely crafted riding whip—a gift of Voldi\'s. Well-dressed, good-looking men of affairs came and went, occasionally nodding to one another. Almost everybody knew everybody else. Fara honestly wished she were a man. They all seemed so effortlessly sure of themselves. She admired their self-sufficiency; tried to make herself think she was one of them. For the most part her presence in the big, dingy room went unnoticed. Sometimes a young man, passing by, would toss an impersonal glance in her direction and move on without giving her a second look. This was good, and Fara breathed more comfortably. Immediately to the left of her, in the row of battered chairs backed against the wall, sat two men engaged in earnest conversation. They spoke in Greek, though it was evident that they were Romans. Fara had never seen any Romans, but she had been told how they looked. The man in the nearest chair was probably forty. It was plain that he was a person of some consequence. Like his friend, who was many years his senior, he was smooth-faced and his greying hair was close-cropped. His face was deeply tanned, except for a narrow strip of white on his upper forehead which a bandeau had protected from the sun. His sand-coloured tunic, trimmed in red, was of fine texture; his belt, dagger-sheath, and tooled-leather sandals, strapped almost to the knee, showed expensive workmanship. Fara surmised that they both were directors of caravans, probably belonging to the same company. Another survey of them revealed that the younger man had a small V-shaped notch in the top of his ear. So—he was a slave. But apparently his servitude didn\'t bother him much. \'I hope he is still there next week when we return,\' the distinguished-looking slave was saying. \'I should like to hear him again. But it is doubtful whether he will be at large by that time. The legionaries will have taken him in; for, as you have said, it was very inflammatory talk. But, by the Gods, Aulus, it was all true—what he was saying.\' \'Yes, yes,\' agreed Aulus, \'the world is bad enough to deserve a drubbing, and it always was. But—the fellow is crazy as a beetle, Tim.\' The older man turned his full face and Fara saw a long scar across his cheek; relic of a savage fight long ago, she thought. \'That\'s where we differ, Aulus,\' countered Tim. \'What the hermit was preaching showed him to be indiscreet, foolhardy; but no merely crazy man could collect a crowd like that and keep them standing for hours in the broiling sun listening with wide eyes and open mouths; and they say he has been doing it day after day!\' \'Oh, you know how people are,\' said Aulus indifferently. \'This half-starved fanatic, living on dreams and desert bugs, climbs up on a big rock and begins to yell that the world is due for punishment. Naturally the rabble, with nothing better to do, gathers around to watch his antics and shudder at his predictions.\' Aulus shifted his position in the creaking chair and continued to extemporize. \'People like to be scared, Tim. Their empty lives are without stimulating sensations and they enjoy feeling the cold shivers run down their backs—especially when their instinct tells them it\'s all a lot of damned nonsense.\' There was quite a pause here, and Fara, who had been intently eavesdropping, leaned forward a little, hoping that Aulus hadn\'t said the last word. Presently Tim remarked soberly, \'I wonder if it is—just damned nonsense.\' \'Poof!\' scoffed Aulus. \'The fellow is crazy as a beetle!\' He rose, stretched, yawned. \'And so are you,\' he added. \'I\'ll see you at supper. I must have another look at that lame camel.\' \'Just a minute, Aulus.\' Tim patted the arm of the adjoining chair and his scar-faced friend sat down again with an indulgent grin. \'You have been talking of that throng at Hebron as if it were composed entirely of ignorant and lousy nobodies who would as gladly stand all day watching a caged monkey scratch itself. But that doesn\'t account for it. There were at least a dozen well-dressed, intelligent men in the crowd giving serious attention to everything the hermit said.\' Aulus dismissed this with a negligent flick of his hand. \'Local citizens, no doubt,\' he explained, \'annoyed by the fellow\'s presence in their town, and waiting for him to start a brawl—so that they could lock him up as a disturber of the peace.\' \'But some of them had come from afar, Aulus. I asked a bright-looking camel-boy if he wanted a job, and he loftily replied that he was in the employ of an eminent lawyer, Ben-Judah, a member of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.\' \'What\'s this Sanhedrin?\' demanded Aulus scornfully. \'The Jews\' law-making body.\' \'I thought Rome made their laws.\' \'Just the laws on taxes. The Sanhedrin attends to the rest of it.\' \'You surely have a strange talent,\' observed Aulus, \'for collecting useless information. What else do you know about Jewish laws?\' \'Only that there are far too many of them. Why, a Jew can be arrested for dragging a chair across his dooryard on the Sabbath! It might dig a little furrow in the ground—and that would be ploughing.\' \'I think you made that up, Timmie,\' chuckled Aulus. \'But—be that as it may—perhaps this wise Ben-Judah, in the course of a journey, turned aside to listen to the prattle of this fool, just as we did—out of curiosity.\' \'Possibly; but it is much more likely that some influential people are spying on this hermit. He himself is a Jew, and he is talking to his own countrymen. Surely the Temple can\'t afford to let this fellow go on, gathering up a bigger crowd every day, shouting that the world is so bad it needs to be cleansed. That\'s the Temple\'s exclusive business: to see that the world—or at least the Jewish world, which is all that matters in this country—behaves itself. These learned lawyers and rabbis surely cannot permit a fiery prophet to march across Judaea, informing thousands of people that their land is filthy with graft, greed, and injustice, all the way from top to bottom; and that his God—who is also theirs—means to take the whole job of renovation out of the hands of the recognized authorities, and attend to it personally!\' Aulus grinned at this long speech and again rose to his feet. \'Perhaps you\'re right,\' he drawled. \'In that case, they will probably toss the hermit into a dungeon—and forget about him. And so will the people. If a man dies a bloody death as a martyr to some new idea, the people remember, and build him a monument; but if he gets pitched into prison—Pouf! Let him rot!\' Aulus dusted his hands and sauntered away. After a while the handsome man with the deep crow\'s-feet at the corners of his eyes and the notch on his ear turned his head slowly toward Fara and coolly looked her over. \'Which way are you headed, young man?\' he inquired in Aramaic, signifying that he considered her a Jew. \'I am going west, sir,\' replied Fara in Greek, \'as far as Gaza.\' \'Ever been there?\' asked Tim, and when Fara had shaken her head, he remarked, \'Very fine place—to lose your shirt and have your throat cut. Let me warn you to ride straight down the middle of the street and have nothing to do with any of the inhabitants. Do not eat their food or drink their water or believe their lies.\' \'I gather that you do not care much for Gaza,\' commented Fara. \'I shall take your advice. The first large city to the west is Hebron, is it not? Is that any better?\' \'Much! Hebron has been sound asleep for two thousand years, so there\'s nothing very lively about it; but at least it won\'t rob you or poison your food or murder you in your bed.\' Tim recrossed his long legs and gave Fara a candid stare. \'How do you happen to speak Greek, young man? You don\'t live in Greece, do you?\' \'Nor do you, sir,\' said Fara with equal bluntness, \'yet you speak Greek.\' \'I am a Greek!\' declared Tim proudly. \'You are a Jew, are you not?\' \'I am not!\' replied Fara. \'I am an Arabian.\' Tim studied her face with interest, pursed his lips, and nodded. \'My mistake,\' he muttered. \'No offence, I hope.\' \'Not at all, sir. I have no quarrel with the Jewish people.\' Tim laughed quietly and said that he never thought he would hear an Arabian say that. \'But it is not so long, sir,\' Fara risked saying, \'since the Jews and Arabians were in alliance.\' \'What an alliance!\' scoffed Tim. \'Of course you know all about that wretched marriage. One thing I never could understand: I know many Arabians—fine fellows who love nothing better than a good fight. Why haven\'t they ripped the bowels out of that Jewish rascal who humiliated your Princess? Surely it can\'t be that they have forgotten—or do not care!\' Unable to think of an appropriate answer to that, Fara abruptly changed the subject by saying: \'I could not help overhearing your talk about a prophet you met who said the world was to be punished for its misdeeds. Does he propose to attend to this chastisement?\' \'No; not he,\' said Tim. \'The fellow was careful to say that he himself was only a courier, announcing the early arrival of a divine person whom he depicted as a mighty avenger, a divinity to be sent from Heaven with an axe in his hand. The rotten old growth we have called Civilization was to be cut down so that something healthy and fruitful might grow.\' \'Coming soon?\' asked Fara. \'You would think, from his talk, that the prophet expected the avenger by next week—at the latest. If he had said it would occur a hundred years from now, his prediction would have been less risky.\' \'And less interesting,\' added Fara. \'Do you think the prophet might be there—at Hebron—tomorrow?\' \'Unless he has moved further toward the hills. He was at least half a mile north of the road when we sighted the crowd. Apparently he does not study the people\'s convenience. They say he goes where he likes and the multitude follows. If you are interested I suggest that you inquire along the way as you approach Hebron. Almost anyone will tell you. The air is full of him over there.\' Tim rose to move away, and Fara also came to her feet. \'Am I right in surmising that you were inclined to believe what he said?\' she asked seriously. Tim tugged at his lip, debating a reply. \'I don\'t know rightly what I do think about it,\' he answered, measuring his words. \'The Jews are a singular people. They have always had their prophets, and many of their predictions have proved true, even to the dating of important events and the outcome of far distant wars. You\'d better hear this man John for yourself. He may be greatly mistaken, but he is no fool!\' \'Your friend says the man is crazy as a beetle,\' said Fara. \'My friend,\' drawled Tim, \'is a typical Greek who became a typical Roman. He doesn\'t believe in anything he can\'t eat or wear or buy or sell or ride.\' In spite of Saidi\'s strong objections to leaving the broad highway, Fara turned off at the unmistakable spot where an improvised road, fully fifty yards wide, led northward through a stubble-field. The tilled ground had been trampled soft and the going was slow. The deserted trail moved on across the field, across another less travelled highway, through another harvested field, over a bridge that spanned a little stream. It curved to miss a grove of cypress, climbed a hill, traversed a pasture, forded a creek, and went on—and on. After five miles of monotonous riding, Fara sighted a village. At the cross-roads a stone said the place was Tekoa. The trail had bypassed the little town, but Fara rode into it. Perhaps someone could inform her how far she must go to find the prophet. The village was quite abandoned. The small bazaars and markets on the principal street were closed. Further on, in the residential section, a frail old woman bent over the ledge of a community well, tugging at the handle of the windlass. Fara drew up alongside, dismounted, and lent a hand. The dripping chain brought up a large wooden bucket which they pulled to anchorage on top of the low wall. The ragged old woman, breathing heavily, gave Fara a toothless smile and offered a rusty iron dipper. \'It is good!\' said Fara. She filled the dipper for her hostess, emptied the bucket into the stone trough beside the well, and slipped off the filly\'s bridle. \'Saidi is thirsty too,\' she added, lowering the bucket again. \'Never knew of a horse named Saidi,\' remarked the old woman. \'Where do you come from, young master?\' \'Arabia.\' \'But you are an Israelite, I think.\' \'No—we are both Arabians, Saidi and I.\' The old woman tightened her shrunken lips and scowled. \'How do you happen to ask a drink of me?\' she demanded crossly. \'Because you seemed friendly; and, besides, I was thirsty,\' replied Fara, unruffled by the woman\'s surliness. \'I shall gladly pay you for the water.\' \'We don\'t sell water.\' \'Here is a little gift, then.\' Fara offered her a shekel. The beady old eyes brightened at the sight of so much money, but the white head shook vigorously. Fara laid the shekel on the ledge of the well. The old woman turned and spat unprettily on the ground. Suppressing her amusement, Fara said, \'I am looking for a Jewish prophet. His name is John. Many people are following him, and I wish to hear him. I think he has passed this way. Do you know where he has gone?\' \'He is a son of Satan!\' shrilled the old woman. \'A blasphemer! Cursed be all the infidels who listen to his revilings of Israel!\' Fara, who had been toying with her coin-pouch, unwound its thong and asked quietly, \'Do you know where he is?\' For a moment the old woman maintained a sullen silence while Fara poured a few silver coins into her own palm. Pouring them back into the pouch, she vaulted into the saddle and gathered up the bridle-reins. The wrinkled old jaw was quivering. Obviously her poverty and her piety were in combat. Impetuously she pointed toward the north-east. \'They said he was heading for the river,\' she shouted, \'and all Judaea is following him! Everybody in Tekoa has joined the infidels!\' Tears ran down the leathery cheeks. \'My own son—and my daughter and her husband—and their children—they too have gone mad, like the others.\' Honestly sorry for the pitiable old creature, who was now weeping aloud, Fara asked quietly, \'But what has this man been saying—to distress you so?\' \'He scorns our ancient faith!\' sobbed the old woman, scrubbing her cavernous eyes with the skirt of her faded apron. \'He sits out there in the desert for years, doing no work, helping nobody, never attending the Synagogue, never bringing a gift to the altar; and now he comes forth railing at the religion of his fathers!\' \'He has a new religion then?\' asked Fara. \'An angel is about to appear, he says, who will show us what to do— as if we were heathen who knew no God.\' \'Your priests are probably annoyed by such talk,\' surmised Fara. \'Annoyed!\' The old woman slowly nodded her head and drew an unpleasant grin. \'You wait! They will soon silence his blasphemies! God is not mocked!\' Fara opened her pouch and poured silver into the wrinkled hand. The old woman clutched the money, scowled, and made an unsuccessful effort to spit. Saidi, who had been pawing the ground impatiently, was pleased to be on their way at a brisk trot. Half an hour before sunset she found them, acres of them it seemed, seated singly or in pairs or by families in a close-nibbled sheep pasture on the high-banked shore of the Jordan. They were busy with their supper, which they had been foresighted enough to bring with them. Fara stopped a little way apart from the area where most of the pack-animals were tethered, hung Saidi\'s bridle on the pommel of the saddle, loosed the girths, adjusted a stout halter, buckled on a well-filled feed-bag, and staked out the tired filly for a hard-earned rest. Strolling forward among the groups of people, she sat down near a good-looking family—father, mother, two half-grown boys, and a pretty girl of her own age. The girl turned her head toward Fara and smiled shyly. Her father instantly muttered an inaudible command and his daughter, with some reluctance, left her place and wedged in between her parents. Fara was amused. She unwrapped her parcel of food and made a leisurely survey of the great multitude. It was a strangely quiet crowd. There was a low, inarticulate rumble of subdued conversation, but all faces were sober, pensive, and there was no laughter to be heard anywhere. A gentle but insistent, one-sided argument was in progress near by. The mother of the adjacent family was pleading earnestly with her husband. Yielding to her importunity he nodded at length, and their well-favoured daughter rose to resume the place where she had sat before. Her long black hair, unbound, was spread out covering her shoulders and back, and she seemed troubled about it. Turning to Fara with a smile she offered her a sweet roll, which was accepted gratefully. \'My hair looks untidy,\' said the girl. \'It\'s wet. I was baptized.\' \'It\'s beautiful,\' said Fara gallantly. \'How did you say it got wet?\' \'The great prophet was baptizing this afternoon.\' \'I\'m afraid I don\'t know,\' confessed Fara. \'What does that mean— baptizing? This is my first time here.\' \'The prophet leads us into the river and pushes us down under the water. That washes away our sins—and we are clean.\' \'And very wet, I suppose,\' remarked Fara sympathetically. The girl\'s full lips parted in a slow, reluctant smile that displayed the tips of beautiful teeth. Unable to think of an appropriate rejoinder to this dry drollery on a solemn occasion, she suddenly sobered and nodded her head. Nothing further was said for a while, Fara regretting that she had spoken flippantly, the pretty Jewess, her face averted, apparently wishing she knew how to explain the cleansing she had had in the Jordan. \'I cannot think that you have been so very sinful,\' ventured Fara gently. \'We are all sinful,\' murmured the girl in a lugubrious imitation of experienced piety. \'Yes—I suppose so,\' admitted Fara with a companionable sigh. \'Do you think the prophet is finished—for the day?\' \'Oh no, he will speak again when the people have had their supper. It should not be long now.\' The young Jewess tipped her head toward the groups who were rising and stirring about. The girl\'s plump mother, now that her family had been fed, wrapped up what was left; and, scrambling to her feet, came over and sat down beside her daughter. She and Fara exchanged amiable smiles. \'I am glad you made friends with our Ruth,\' she leaned forward to say. \'There are so few young people here of her own age. Hundreds of us older ones and swarms of small children; but it seems that our young people nowadays—\' She broke off abruptly in response to an imploring look from her daughter, but immediately continued, \'They don\'t seem to know that they have souls to save from the wrath to come!\' Ruth turned her head slowly toward Fara, with an expression that apologized for her zealous mother. Quite at a loss for a suitable comment, Fara mumbled, \'Probably not,\' quickly aware that it was the wrong thing to have said, for it showed a deplorable unconcern. The woman\'s eyes were alive with reproach. \'Young man,\' she said severely, \'may I ask whether you have come to seek salvation?\' \'I came to see and hear the prophet,\' replied Fara. \'But not your own soul\'s salvation?\' demanded the woman. \'The prophet is interested only in his own countrymen, I think,\' said Fara. \'Of course! But you are an Israelite, are you not?\' \'I am an Arabian.\' \'Then you have no right to be here at all!\' \'But—mother!\' pleaded Ruth. \'Never mind! You come with me!\' Rising, the indignant Jewess drew her embarrassed daughter to her feet. \'Good-bye.\' Ruth turned to say softly. Fara, who had risen, bowed and said with her lips rather than her voice, \'I\'m sorry.\' Striding through the milling crowd she observed that the people well forward were seating themselves compactly in rows. Finding an unoccupied spot, she sat down to wait. Presently a murmur of expectation swept the great audience. The prophet John, who had evidently been resting by the river\'s brink, appeared over the top of the embankment. He was indeed a striking figure, tall, lean, lithe, bronzed. His heavy, tousled hair indicated an immense latent vitality. His massive head was held high above broad, bony shoulders. The craggy face was bearded, the forehead deep-lined, the dark eyes deep-set. He had the bearing of a man who had thought much and suffered. The crowd was very still. Stretching forth his long brown arms, the prophet began to speak in a tone and mood of quiet entreaty. Fara found herself yielding at once to the strange compulsion of his vibrant voice. It was as one speaking from a great distance; from another age; from another world. God had been patient—long—long. Of old He had planted a garden of delicious fruits and scented flowers for the delight of the human creatures He had made. It was a spacious garden, watered by cool springs and graceful rivers, along whose green banks were to be found much gold and many precious stones. On the hillsides jutted various metals which man\'s ingenuity might fashion into ploughs, pruning-hooks and other implements of husbandry. Great quarries bulged with enduring granite and delicately tinted marbles with which man might build temples and monuments. There were tall forests filled with all manner of trees from which might be hewn boats and shelters. Innumerable beasts pastured in the valleys, some to provide food, some to bear burdens. And had God\'s fortunate children been content to preserve and bequeath their rich heritage, their posterity might still be living comfortably and at peace in a garden. Here the voice of the prophet rose to a little higher pitch as he proceeded to relate how this paradise was permitted to grow rank with weeds and brambles. For, from the very beginning, God\'s children cared nothing about the garden. The first man flouted God\'s instructions. The elder of his two sons slew his brother and fled to the jungle. Restless and dissatisfied, humanity abandoned their paradise and began to roam, everywhere, without food, clothing, shelter, or destination, hoping only to escape the reproving eyes of their disappointed Father. Sometimes, after long and aimless wandering, a group or tribe would settle in a fertile valley and till the soil. Another nomadic tribe, jealous of their neighbours\' small prosperities, would come upon them with spears and swords and stones, killing the workers together with their old and helpless ones and their little children. Their Father had endowed them with inventive minds, so that they might make better and better tools, but their most ingenious inventions were not better tools but deadlier weapons. Stone was not quarried for the building of temples and monuments, but for great fortifications. Iron was not moulded into implements of husbandry but into instruments of war. Everywhere there was fear, hardship, hunger. Pillage, rapine, and slaughter spread over the face of the world until there was no peace at all, anywhere at all, and a man was not safe even in the home of his brother. But—John was continuing with mounting heat—throughout all these dreadful ages of hatred and oppression, God had waited, waited patiently, anxiously for the world\'s great ones to become aware of the poverty of their ill-gained wealth, and the empty sham of their vaunted power, and the shabbiness of their royal raiment, and the stink of starvation in their pilfered food. Now and again some brave voice would be raised in warning, but it would soon be stilled. Many were the messengers, sent of God, who were beaten, imprisoned and slain; fed to wild beasts, sawn asunder. As a child, Fara had heard the legends about the world\'s creation, the disobedience of Adam, the wickedness of his posterity, and the great flood that had drowned them all—except one family. But the ancient tales, as John recited them, seemed fresh and frightening. For now his voice was at storm! God\'s patience was exhausted! He finally gave up hope of seeing His incorrigible children develop any beauty, any grace, any goodness, any peace. He determined to wash the world clean of them—thoroughly clean of them—and their filth and their spoor and the ravages of their hands until not a trace or a track or a trail of them remained! He told one peace- abiding old man to build a boat for his household; and the rain began to fall. The rain kept on coming—and coming—day after day after day. It poured as no rain had ever poured before! Fara had listened, quite unmoved, when the wandering minstrels had sung of the fabled rain, but today the graphic picture of that appalling disaster made her draw her burnous tightly about her shoulders. The story made her flesh creep, as she heard the hoarse cries and strangled gasps of the doomed, clutching at one another in the swirl of rising waters, while the livid sky roared and the tempest screamed and the lightning stabbed relentlessly at the tossing debris. And then—there was a sudden calm. The waters stilled and subsided. The sun was shining again; not upon a garden this time, but upon a stripped, deserted world of ruined cities levelled to the ground, and of empty thrones half-buried in the mud. Now men could begin anew and try to build a better world. But it was without any success—and without any promise. John\'s voice took on a tone of deep sadness—and of shame too—as he reported how these men, wading out of the ooze and slime, began again to plot against one another as before. Prophets came and went, reminding the people of the great calamity that had befallen their fathers and predicting more trouble if they did not now obey God\'s command for peace. But the stronger ones ignored them and those who sought the favour of the stronger ones laughed at them, and even the weak, who were set upon daily and robbed of their very rags—they too mocked the prophets and threw stones. Here John paused for a long time—and bowed his head. The awed multitude sat transfixed, far-eyed, holding its breath, though well it knew what was coming. \'So—now—in these latter days,\' he went on sadly, measuring his phrases, \'it is our fate to witness another outpouring of God\'s wrath. It is not a flood this time, but a purge of the world\'s wickedness. You will ask, \\"When is it coming?\\" And I shall answer, \\"It is not coming: it is here!\\" \'And do I hear you say, \\"It is not my fault that the world is wicked: it is the Empire that enslaves and robs and kills; am I to be punished for the crimes of Caesar?\\" Then I must answer you that every one of us is guilty!\' John\'s words came fast now, fast and scathing. \'Do not blame all injustice, all cruelty, all meanness on Caesar\'s Empire! For each one of you is a little empire filled with lust and greed and hate! It is easy enough to condemn the government, which is, indeed, a rapacious thing that God will cleanse and cleanse until its bones show through! Easy enough to denounce the Temple for its well-fed lethargy: it deserves and will receive just punishment! But if any peace is to bless this sick world, salvation must first come to you—to you, the lonely shepherd in the hills; to you, the farmer at the plough; to you, the carpenter at the bench; to you, the housewife at the loom; to you, rabbi; to you, lawyer; to you, scribe; to you, magistrate. For—except you repent, you shall perish! It is so decreed. God has again spoken. There is One near at hand to rid the world of its iniquities! Indeed—He is now here!\' Suddenly a black-robed, distinguished-looking man of middle age, at the far end of the second row, arose from the small group of similarly well-groomed company surrounding him and called out in a loud voice that turned all eyes his way: \'Meaning you, Baptizer? Are you, then, this avenger who will wreak God\'s wrath upon Caesar—and the High Priest—and upon us all?\' \'No, I am not He,\' answered John humbly. \'I am but His courier, unworthy to stoop down and buckle His sandal-straps. I am but a voice, crying in the desert. I am commanded to say: make the way straight for the oncoming of the Anointed One. Level the road! Lift up the valleys where the poor despair! Pare down the mountain-tops where the powerful have sat in their arrogance and pride! Level the road for Him in your own hearts!\' Here the impassioned voice lashed out like the crack of a bull-whip. \'Do not be content with saying that the world might find justice and peace if the Greeks stopped hating the Egyptians and the Romans stopped robbing the Greeks! Look to yourselves! Let the Macedonian merchant stop hating the Syrian camel-driver! Let the Jew stop hating the Arab! Let the Pharisees and Sadducees stop hating one another! Let the poor farmer with two cows and an ass and twenty chickens stop his sneering at the poor farmer with only two goats and ten chickens! Let the woman with the fine cloak for Sabbath and the wedding-feast stop her haughtiness toward the woman with only a week-day cloak and no wedding garment!\' Another man of the little company of critics now stood up in his place and said, \'Does this avenger come with a sword—to make peace?\' \'Not with a sword,\' said John, \'but none the less with a power so mighty that the whole world will be shaken by it! He comes with an axe and a flail! The axe will be laid at the roots of all the trees. Every tree that bears fruit will be spared, but every tree that is barren and an encumbrance to the ground will be cut down and burned! His flail will thresh the harvest of your deeds. He will save the grain, but the chaff will be blown away!\' It was some moments before the crowd realized that the prophet had made an end of speaking, for he stood in silence before the people, with his head bowed in weariness; or perhaps, Fara thought, in silent prayer. At length he lifted his head, turned slowly, and walked away toward the neighbouring hill to the north. Their eyes followed him until he disappeared among the scraggy olive trees. Wordlessly and without looking at one another, they rose and moved toward the camp-sites they had chosen in the broad pasture-field. Dazed and bewildered, Fara followed the slow-moving crowd. She found herself abreast of the family she had met at supper. The pretty girl, Ruth, gave her a sidelong glance and smiled. Her mother, alert to her daughter\'s behaviour, scowled and muttered intentionally loud enough for Fara to hear, \'Any more of that and I shall tell your father!\' Having brought no camping equipment except a pair of camel- hair rugs, Fara slept for the first time in her life under the open sky. She retired early, for there was little else to do. A half-grown boy had been given a few pennies for bringing water to Saidi, after which Fara had removed the saddle and bridle, carrying them to a grassy spot near a cypress tree. During the slow twilight the people quietly pitched their simple camps, and by the time the stars appeared in full splendour the pasture-field was still. Occasionally a tired baby cried, a dog barked, there was a brief argument among the pack-asses; but the people were quiet. Fara wondered whether they slept or reflected soberly on the strange words they had heard. The distinguished men from the city—what were they thinking? Ruth\'s mother—did she say to herself that at least she was innocent of any fault? And what would this peace-loving prophet think if he knew that one of his interested auditors was on her way to kill her own father? It was a long time before her mental confusion gave way to her bodily fatigue. She went to sleep wondering whether Arabia, too, would be warned of what was coming. And would anyone speak to the Romans about it? Surely the world was larger than Judaea. Even before dawn there was a stir of activity. Fara rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, sat up and combed her boyish hair, drew the red bandeau down over her forehead, rolled up her rugs, and set off to see how Saidi had fared. Saidi was gone! There was the stake to which she had been tethered, but Saidi was nowhere to be seen. Doubtless she had contrived to tug loose and wander away. She might even be well started for home. Intelligent horses were known to do that. After fruitless inquiries of the men and boys who were attending to their beasts, Fara decided to climb the hill for a wider view. As she reached the summit, her heart beating hard with the exertion and alarm, she shaded her eyes and carefully surveyed the plain below, every rod of it, from the faraway north to the congested encampment; but there was no sight of Saidi. She suddenly felt so weak and faint that she laid a hand against the trunk of a tree for support against the westerly morning breeze. She started at the sound of a voice immediately behind her. \'What are you looking for, daughter?\' Fara turned slowly to confront the prophet, who was regarding her with sober eyes. \'My horse,\' she replied unsteadily, returning to her search of the valley. \'She must have wandered away in the night.\' \'May have been stolen,\' suggested John, advancing to stand beside her. \'Surely no one, among these people, would steal!\' said Fara. \'There is no place in this greedy world, my daughter, where men do not steal.\' There it was again—\'my daughter.\' Fara hoped she had misunderstood, the first time; but there was no doubt about it now. Somehow he knew. But she must listen, for he was speaking quietly, almost as if to himself. \'They steal. They steal anything, everything, anywhere, everywhere; anything from a horse to a halter; anywhere from a scroll in the Synagogue to a vase in the graveyard. They steal on the farm, in the marketplace, on the highway, at the inn, at the goldsmith\'s, at the rag-picker\'s, in the gambling-house, and in the Temple. There is no limit to it. They steal from babes and pennies from dead men\'s eyes. They steal from bankers and beggars. Where do you live, young woman, that you should be incredulous of theft?\' \'I am from Arabia,\' said Fara. John chuckled briefly, but without smiling. \'You must have lived a sheltered life,\' he said dryly. \'Your people have taken no prizes for honesty. Perhaps you are not very well acquainted with your countrymen. Have you always lived in Arabia? I detect an accent on your tongue, though I must say your Aramaic is correct. How do you happen to speak it? And you look Jewish—as much Jewish as Arabian. Tell me, daughter, why are you wearing a man\'s burnous; and why that shorn hair?\' Fara\'s knees were giving way now, and she sat down. The prophet seated himself on a small boulder near by. Slowly turning her face toward him, she encountered a searching gaze that compelled frankness. \'I am on an errand, sir, that could not be safely performed by a young woman. I told you that I am an Arabian because I prefer to think of myself that way; but it is only half true. My mother was an Arabian. My father is a Jew.\' \'Your mother is dead?\' \'Only three days ago.\' Fara turned her eyes toward the valley. \'And that sent you on your errand, I think; and your errand takes you to Judaea, and your father is a Jew. Perhaps you go to notify him of your mother\'s death.\' \'Ye-yes,\' stammered Fara, hoping the answer might suffice. There was a considerable silence before John spoke. \'So it is something else besides telling your father. Has he not lived with your mother in Arabia?\' \'Not for many years.\' \'How did they happen to marry?\' \'It\'s quite a long story, sir. I have no wish to detain you.\' She looked again into his inquiring eyes. \'Must I tell you?\' she asked, in a voice that seemed a little frightened. \'Not if you don\'t want to,\' said John kindly, \'but perhaps it might help—if you confided in someone you could trust.\' \'I am on my way to find my father,\' said Fara. \'He lives in Galilee—at the city of Tiberias.\' \'Then he must be in the employ of the Tetrarch,\' surmised John. \'There is little else in Tiberias but the great establishment of Antipas.\' Fara nodded and turned her eyes away. Tardily and in a barely audible, reluctant voice she said, \'Antipas is my father.\' John seemed a person not easily surprised, but he impulsively rose to his feet and exclaimed, \'You don\'t mean it!\' He searched her face, and apparently satisfied that she was telling the truth, he said, \'Of course I know the story. Everyone does. You have no cause to be proud of your father.\' \'I am quite aware of that, sir,\' agreed Fara. \'But—surely—after the cruel and shameful treatment he gave the Princess of Arabia, you are not going to Tiberias to live with this—\' \'I have vowed to avenge my mother,\' interrupted Fara huskily. \'You mean—you would kill your father?\' \'If I can.\' \'But you can\'t!\' exclaimed John. \'In the first place, it\'s quite impossible. The place is fortified like a besieged city. I was born a Galilean, and my friends have told me that the Tetrarch lives like a fugitive, heavily guarded by night and day. You would only lose your life to no purpose at all. And—even if you succeeded, which is inconceivable, your crime would haunt you all your days. No good ever comes of revenge.\' \'I heard you say yesterday that there was One arriving now to avenge God,\' said Fara. \'Is no good to come of that?\' John did not have an answer ready. After some delay, he said, \'That is a far different matter, my daughter. Vengeance is permitted only to God. He will repay!\' \'But I mustn\'t!\' Fara\'s tone was satirical. \'It\'s all right for God to seek vengeance—but it is wrong for me to do it. I\'m supposed to have a finer moral character?\' \'That remark,\' reproved John, \'does you small credit, daughter. It is irreverent.\' \'But practical,\' defended Fara. \'And excusable, I suppose,\' reflected John. \'You probably had no religious training—in Arabia.\' \'Why not?\' Fara demanded. \'The Jews and Arabians worship the same God, do we not? Abraham is our common father; is that not so?\' Any further discussion of this matter seeming fraught with more heat than light, John nodded absently. \'Perhaps you may see the Anointed One in Galilee,\' he said. \'I wish you might be able to talk with Him. He lives in the town of Nazareth. He is a carpenter.\' \'Disguised as a carpenter?\' wondered Fara. \'Same as I am disguised as a boy?\' \'No, He really is a carpenter, and a very good one, whereas you are only pretending to be a boy—\' \'And not doing so well at it,\' she broke in, with a pensive smile. \'However,\' she added, \'you are the first one to discover.\' \'You mean—I am the first one to tell you.\' John paced back and forth, frowning thoughtfully. \'But this is no light matter,\' he went on. \'You have vowed a vow. I shall not be the one to induce you to break it. A vow is a vow. You are intent upon going to Tiberias. Very well. Go first to Nazareth: it is not far from there. Tell your story to the Carpenter—Jesus. Abide by His counsel. You will make no mistake if you do as He tells you... I must leave you now. Since your horse is gone, you will proceed on foot, I suppose. Follow the Jordan. It is much shorter than by the travelled roads and it will be safer for you.\' Pointing to an angling path down the northern slope of the hill, he said, \'May God be with you, daughter, and keep you safe from any harm.\' He extended a big, bony hand, and she confidently gave him her small one. Turning it about for inspection, he smiled. \'It is not a boy\'s hand. You must be very careful. I can\'t advise you, now that your hair is shorn, to dress as a girl should; but,\' he repeated gently, \'you must be careful. Those riding boots, that fine burnous. You should get into less conspicuous clothing—peasant\'s clothes—as soon as possible. You could be thrown into prison for this, you know.\' \'That would be unpleasant,\' said Fara. \'They say that prisons are very uncomfortable.\' \'I have never been in one,\' said John, \'but I expect to be—at almost any hour now. The authorities will arrest me as a disturber of the peace.\' \'But there is no peace,\' said Fara. \'No—there is no peace,\' agreed John soberly. \'Is it the Temple that would silence you?\' \'Yes—but the Temple has no authority to imprison me.\' \'Who, then?\' \'The provincial government; and as I am a Galilean I shall be taken before Antipas.\' \'Then—we may meet again—in prison.\' Fara smiled grimly. John shook his shaggy head in reproof of her ill-timed levity. \'It is quite clear that you do not realize the utter hopelessness of your undertaking, my child,\' he said sadly. \'I do not expect ever to see you again... Farewell.\' \'Until we meet,\' persisted Fara. Halfway down the long hill, she turned and looked back. John was still standing where she had left him. She waved a hand and he extended his arm, as if to give her his final blessing. It was early morning on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Enough remained of an unusually hot summer to strip the fishermen to the waist, but intimations of autumn were in the smoky haze that overcast the distant mountains, obscured the dome of the new Synagogue in Capernaum, and dulled the sheen of the Tetrarch\'s marble palace. The ugly huddle of weather-beaten shacks and wharves where the fishermen kept their tackle and dried their nets had come alive to the day\'s work. Browned, bushy, bare-footed men and youths scampered about on the docks, loading flat-bottomed dories with equipment for the larger craft which rocked indolently in the quiet cove, tugging in unison at their anchor-chains. Fully a score of these boats, of all shapes, sizes, ages, and degrees of dirtiness and disrepair, were congregated in the bay, waiting for their skippers and crews to haul up the much-mended sails and wallow forth to what they hoped might be promising fishing-grounds. Haughtily apart from the clutter of nondescript old tubs, and conspicuous for their trimness, lay a fleet of three blue-hulled schooners moored side by side and so closely lashed together from midship to stern that their freshly painted gunwales would have chafed but for the heavy hempen pads that cushioned them. Built for stability, they were broad in the beam and sat low in the water; and they were of identical design, though the central ship, The Abigail, carried three masts and was somewhat larger than her two-masted companions, The Sara and The Rachael. Tethered loosely about their prows bobbed half a dozen empty dories. On the closely yoked afterdecks the combined crews, totalling thirty and ranging in age from sixteen to sixty, sat cross-legged a few feet apart, forming a circle around a huge net that plainly needed extensive repairs. Alone on the broad tiller-seat of The Abigail a gigantic, hairy, deeply tanned Galilean of thirty-five—as busy with his awl as were his employees—occasionally looked up to survey their work, and sometimes they met his eyes as if to inquire whether he was satisfied with what they were doing. They all worked skilfully, swiftly, and in silence, though their faces did not indicate that they were hard-driven. It was obvious that the relation of the master and his men was cordial; indeed, it was better than cordial, for there was evident in their diligence a desire to please. Especially was this loyalty noticeable in the attitude of the younger ones, who seemed proud of their employment, as they had reason to be, for it was a testimonial to a man\'s seamanship if he was signed on to sail under Simon the son of Jonas. Among the Galileans the name of Simon was so common that it had to be tagged for better identification. Every Simon bore a special designation: Simon the tanner, Simon the weaver, Simon the clubfoot, Simon the juggler, Simon the little, Simon the scribe, Simon the sot, Simon the bald, Simon the son of Jonas. Doubtless if the skipper\'s sire had been less distinguished, an appellation appropriate to his characteristics would have been promptly contrived for him by the community. In that case he might have become known early in his youth as Simon the brawler, or Simon the scoffer. But to the neighbours and relatives who had known him since childhood he was Simon the son of Jonas; and—they were likely to add—not much of a credit to the good old man; for nobody was more fanatically devoted to the Synagogue than Jonas, and nobody had less use for it than his tough and burly son Simon. It was inevitable, however, that the huge, noisy, quick-tempered, lamentably irreverent son of Jonas should become known by a more colourful name. All up and down the western shore, throughout Capernaum, Magdala, Bethsaida, and the hamlets between, and at the Roman fort, and among the servants in the great villa of the Tetrarch, and on the lake, and in the country round about, Simon the son of Jonas was referred to as the Big Fisherman. From early boyhood the sacrilegious and belligerent Simon had been a growing affliction to his parents. True, he obeyed the laws, specializing in a scrupulous observance of the Fifth Commandment, which in this case was not easy; for the religious duties of Jonas, his diligent attention to all the fasts and feasts, his frequent pilgrimages to Jerusalem, and his unctuous exhortations on the streets and in the market-place left him but little time for any gainful employment; and had it not been for the industry of Simon and his elder brother, Andrew, their parents would have lived on meagre fare. As for the docile bachelor Andrew, his idea of keeping the Fifth Commandment had required his regular attendance at the services of the Synagogue and a strict observance of the stated fasts, but it had laid no such burden on Simon, whose conception of honouring his father and mother did not go any further than being kind and respectful to them and seeing to it that they were well fed and clothed. By the time he was twelve Simon heartily despised the Synagogue and everything it represented, because, he felt, it had made a loafer and a tiresome bore of an otherwise fine man. By a practice of great restraint, he never disclosed his private contempt for his father\'s sanctimoniousness. Sometimes it was difficult to exhibit a proper respect when, on business in the markets, he would come upon Jonas parading the aisles, scroll in hand, solemnly haranguing the customers, who rarely paused to give heed and more often grinned and winked at one another as he passed by. But if Simon\'s attitude toward his father was circumspect, he found a measure of relief for his pent-up feelings by a forthright excoriation of religion when in the company of his young contemporaries. He was still beardless when all the friends and acquaintances of the family referred to him as an infidel—and an uncommonly noisy one. Jonas knew it and deplored it with tears, and prayed aloud in the public places for his wayward son; but ate with relish the provender that the incorrigible sceptic brought home. Beginning as a mere roustabout and chore-boy on a dirty trawler, his wages paid in low-grade mud-suckers, which he peddled from door to door among the very poor, Simon had gradually made himself useful enough to be in a bargaining position among the fleet-owners; for he was strong as an ox and fearless to the point of foolhardiness. In weather that tied up most of the ships in the cove at Tiberias—for the little sea could be dangerously rough on short notice—Simon would be eager to go out and do battle with the waves; and the catch—taken in such circumstances—fetched higher prices for lack of competition. And so it was that before he was twenty-three Simon owned a half-share in a fairly good fishing-smack. At twenty-eight he owned it fully and had taken on a crew of four. And now he was master of the most prosperous and best known fleet on the lake. As his self-made success increased, the Big Fisherman\'s character reflected both his earlier frustrations and his current achievements, not always to his credit. Conscious of having missed almost everything that lent enchantment to a normal childhood, he was inclined to be contemptuous of youngsters who wasted their time at play when they might be making themselves useful. He had never been to school; could hardly read and rarely tried to write anything more than his own name. In consequence of this illiteracy, he scoffed at education and considered the professional scrivener an object of ridicule. Physical weakness he viewed with smiling condescension. As for his loyalties and enthusiasms, Simon, though stridently irreligious, possessed a passionate love of his race. Not to be a Jew was equivalent to not being anybody at all. In his regard all nations except Israel were of one ignominious category. If they were in any way different, their distinctions were trivial. Never having travelled more than twenty-five miles from home—and privately sensitive about his provincialism—he had accumulated quite a lot of prejudices about the world beyond little Galilee. He spoke derisively of people who lived in cities, even Jewish cities. The Greeks foolishly pretended to be better scholars than the Romans, when the fact was that they were only lazier than the Romans and idled their time away on such fripperies as stone statues and the spinning of arguments concerning theories on which one man\'s guess was as good as another\'s; with nothing to come of it, no matter who was right. The Romans had proved themselves better fighters than their weaker neighbours, but so were dogs better fighters than conies, when it came to that. The Egyptians were in decay and thought only of building tombs to house their bones. And Arabia had never been anything but a murderous horde of liars, cheats, and robbers. Israel was not only the Chosen Race but the Human Race. The rest of the people were no better than animals. Simon could and did discourse on this subject by the hour. He was an Israelite indeed! And he was loyal to his comrades. From boyhood he had shown an extraordinary talent for making friends among all classes of people. He had an instinctive love of common justice and fair play, though he was not always himself a cheerful loser. He liked practical jokes but preferred not to be the object of them; and, sometimes, when finding himself at a momentary disadvantage, the Big Fisherman would display a childish petulance that seemed amusingly incongruous when exhibited by a man of his heroic stature. In short, success had turned Simon\'s head a little. Having come up through many tribulations into a conspicuous prosperity, he was intolerant of other men\'s failures to achieve. He liked to be complimented upon his accomplishments and was not reluctant to speak pleasantly of them himself. But—for all his vanity, his intolerance, and his wide assortment of showy weaknesses, his employees idolized him, worked long hours for him, applauded his strength, laughed immoderately at his clumsy witticisms; and, when off duty, imitated his swagger. By the time the Big Fisherman had won his prowess as a fleet-owner, saintly old Jonas and his mousey wife Rachael had been summoned from their cottage in Capernaum to an abode Elsewhere, leaving him free to marry young Abigail of Bethsaida, who lived with her widowed mother Hannah. Andrew, who rarely offered any unsolicited advice to his more resourceful brother, perhaps because he was an employee, had gently cautioned Simon against this marriage; for Abigail, though winsome and pretty, had no health at all. Doubtless it was her very flower-like fragility that had attracted the big, brawny fellow whose latent talent for tenderness had never been given a chance to develop. He had been very considerate of Abigail. As she slowly faded, the common solicitude and sorrow shared by Simon and Hannah greatly endeared them to one another, and when his girl-wife died he continued to live with his much-cherished mother-in-law in her commodious home on a quiet, shady corner in the northern suburbs of Bethsaida. Andrew joined them; though, unwilling to burn his bridges until satisfied that this arrangement was mutually agreeable, he kept the old family residence in Capernaum intact and often went there to tend the flowers. Now that the shadow was lifted from the small household in Bethsaida, it took on an unaccustomed brightness, for Hannah was gifted with a quiet drollery and an inexhaustible good humour refreshing to the brothers who had found so little to amuse them in their parental home. Andrew, sober and taciturn, allowed many a quip to pass unnoticed, though he could be depended upon to give an amiable, bewildered smile. Simon\'s big, booming laugh, on an open-windowed summer evening, could be heard a long way off. Near neighbours often wondered, rather testily, what manner of entertainment could produce such hilarity. It was the general opinion of the conservatives in that part of the town that the Big Fisherman had added little to the gentility of Bethsaida. But though they regarded Simon with scant respect, there was one thing about him that stirred their curiosity—and their envy too. He seemed to be on friendly terms with David, the wealthy, haughty Sadducee. Up the cross-street which bounded Hannah\'s property on the north side and rose gently for a quarter-mile to the east, lay the spacious grounds and imposing old mansion of the eminent Zadok family, now reduced in numbers to a pair of unmarried, middle-aged aristocrats and a score of elderly servants. Old Zadok, the departed grandfather of David and Deborah, had held himself aloof from the town; nor had Bethsaida made any effort to intrude upon his lofty isolation, for he was a Sadducee, the only Sadducee in all that region, and if he wanted to live in seclusion Bethsaida was willing he should do so, the Sadducees being of a cynical, supercilious sect that affected a social superiority. Nor was that all that ailed old Zadok and the Sadducees, in the opinion of Bethsaida. It was a known fact that he hated the government of Galilee and had been heard to speak scornfully of Antipas the Tetrarch. It was a wonder he hadn\'t got into trouble about that. Of course he paid exorbitant taxes. Rich men who paid large taxes might be able to speak their minds more recklessly than poor people, who for the same indiscretion could be clapped in jail. Maybe it was better not to have much to do with the Zadoks or any other Sadducee. Just why David had retained his residence at the old palace on the hill was a mystery, for until his recent retirement he was seldom at home. Maybe it was the commanding view of the lake that had held him and brought him back for his summers. Surely it was inconvenient for him to have lived there during his active life, for his law practice was in Caesarea and the only local client he served was Jairus, whose large estate lay in the foothills above Capernaum. Now David, it seemed, was home to stay; and on fair days it was his habit to stroll slowly down the hill, with bent head, apparently in deep meditation. Persons meeting him did not venture to speak, nor did he lift his eyes. Doubtless he was too busy with his own thoughts to take any account of them. It was not surprising, therefore, that Hannah\'s neighbours should have been amazed the first time David stopped beside her white picket fence to engage the Big Fisherman in what seemed to be a serious, man-to-man conversation. And this happened again and again, usually of a late afternoon when Simon had returned from his work. Sometimes Hannah joined them, presumably at David\'s suggestion. It was all very mysterious. But while this friendship between Simon the uncouth and David the refined was incomprehensible to the Bethsaidans, whose social status was approximately level, it was not so unaccountable as it seemed; for though aristocracy might shudder at the thought of contamination with persons a notch or two lower in the social scale, it was willing to unbend pleasantly for those who, everybody knew, had no rating at all—and would not be expecting an invitation to dinner. In this case, however, there was still better reason for the friendship of the lawyer and the fisherman. The seed of it had been sown many years before, when Simon, a self-conscious, ragged, immensely overgrown youngster, had regularly delivered fish at the Zadoks\' kitchen door. David, his senior by a decade, occasionally encountered him on a garden path and stopped to feel his bulging muscles in about the same careless manner with which he tousled the ears of his dog; and Simon would grin and mumble \'Yes, sir\' to David\'s playful comments on the astounding number of his freckles and the prodigious size of his bare feet. And then David had gone away to school in Athens; absent for five years. Returning, he had joined an eminent law firm in Caesarea, then rapidly becoming a metropolis, and was seen only rarely, briefly, in Bethsaida. At wide-spaced intervals Simon passed him. David would nod and smile, absently. Even after arriving at something like dignity in his lowly occupation, Simon had continued personally to deliver choice fish to a few important patrons: to the Tetrarch\'s palace, of course, and to the Zadok mansion, and—for a while—to Jairus\' beautiful villa, though latterly he had given that up; it was too far. Now that David, slightly stooped and grey, had come home for good, Simon often saw him sauntering about on the grounds. One day they met. Without any preliminary greeting, David said, \'Still peddling fish, eh? Surely you should have found a better job by now.\' Simon was offended, but kept his temper. \'I do have a better job, sir. I do not peddle fish. True, I still select them carefully for you and bring them myself to your house—and to the Tetrarch—but I could easily send them.\' If Simon had thought to flatter his customer by mentioning that the House of Zadok and the Villa of the Tetrarch were somehow of the same standing in his esteem, he was quickly set right about that. David\'s lip curled unpleasantly. \'So—that abominable drunkard eats fish, eh?\' he muttered. \'I had supposed he lived exclusively on beverages.\' Simon didn\'t care to risk a comment on this seditious speech, but he nodded perfunctorily; and David, dismissing the subject with a flick of his fingers, said, \'You\'re doing well, then. Perhaps you own a market.\' Simon\'s lips twitched with a grin that hinted at something better than a market. \'No, sir. I am still a fisherman, but I own my ships and have a score and ten men in my employ.\' \'That is very good,\' commented David. \'I am glad you have prospered. I dare say you have a home—and family.\' Simon explained briefly about that, and David was respectfully sympathetic. After a little pause, he remarked, \'Perhaps you have some office in the Synagogue, now that you have done so well in business.\' \'No, sir,\' replied Simon almost bluntly. \'I have no time for the Synagogue.\' \'You mean—you are not religious?\' inquired David, surprised. \'Well, sir...\' Simon shifted his weight, deliberating a reply. \'I believe in the God of our fathers—who made the world—and gives us our life—and the sunshine, rain and harvests. I do not believe that He takes any notice of our small doings—or cares whether we roast calves and lambs in His honour.\' \'Very well spoken,\' said David soberly. \'You are thoughtful... I bid you good-day.\' That brief conversation had marked the beginning of an acquaintance that was ripening to a friendship. There were frequent talks thereafter, Simon encouraged to speak his mind freely and David nodding his approval. Even when Simon had ventured quite beyond his depth and it was obvious that he didn\'t know what he was talking about, David—in need of diversion—would slowly nod his head and smile. Then came the visits at the fence, which brought all that section of Bethsaida to the window. And one afternoon David consented to come into the yard and sit down with Simon in the shade of the tall cypress, and Hannah brought them cups of pomegranate juice. The early morning haze had lifted now. The sun had scented the old tarred ropes and softened the pitch in the deck-seams. The sailors worked in silence, deftly spreading open the frayed cords of the net and weaving into them the new twine. Simon straightened his back, scratched his bushy head with his awl, and shaded his sweating brow for keener observation of the dory that was slowly approaching from the docks. His face lighted up. Other eyes followed his inquisitively. \'Who\'s that with John?\' mumbled Andrew. \'I don\'t recognize him,\' said Simon. \'Some youngster wanting a job maybe.\' \'Looks like a tramp,\' thought James."}]';
