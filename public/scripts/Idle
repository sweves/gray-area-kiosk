Title: Idle

Modern society craves instant gratification. Every year, clickbait articles and Buzzfeed listicles reach the top pages of the internet, being read by millions. Meanwhile, books gather dust in basements of local libraries around the world, another year forgotten. The effort to publish a physical book and the effort to churn out a list of the â€œ29 GIFS That Show Why Kittens Are Better Than Puppies" are exponentially different. Your favorite book is the work of many hands and disciplined crafts, while in the digital world we push an article out to quickly pull readers in no matter how long they stay - then it's on to the next one. This juxtaposition makes a book idling on the shelf that much more tragic. 

Contained within this project is a database of text determined to be forgotten by combing through the basement of the Oakland Public Library and searching for books with no date checked out stamps, books with fresh spines, and books that were not even yet entered into the digital catalog system.

This installation asks you to become an evangelist for those books, for they are not yet really forgotten, they are just idling waiting for the right person to kickstart their journey. Press the button, take a sticker, and fill the world around you with thoughts no longer forgotten.
